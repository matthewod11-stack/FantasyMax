( Pj O'Brien) is barely surviving their 2 game losing streak but is still in a strong position to make the playoffs, their seeding is another story. \nWe have 2 \"playoff\" games this week, where the winner gaurantees themselves a playoff spot. \n12.5 PSI to freedom (Mike Boggiano) VS. ODEEZUS (Michael O'Donnell)\nand\nThe Nastiest Sack (PJ Miles) VS. HOODIE CRÜ\n (Billy O'Brien too cool for Facebook). \nIt's worth noting Billy's 5 game winning streak is the most clutch performance the league has seen in it's 1 year existence, starting the season as a laughing stock and ending as a match up nightmare.  \nBen's Sack Fumblers (Ben) also controls his own fate against the very tough AceBoog1e crew.  With a win, Big Ben will be the 6th and final seed in the playoffs.  \nWith a loss there will between a 3 and 5 team tie at 6-7 for the final playoff spot.  \nThe tie breaker will be decided by total points scored according to Yahoo!.  I'm open to changing that little rule shuld there be a consensus...as my team hasn't scored any points the last 3 weeks I'd be towards the bottom of the tie breaker so I'd obviously be open to an amendment making things more interesting. \nLast but not least..\nHome Balogna pt duex (Jim Williamson) and Laces Out (Nick Frigenti) are battling eachother for the title of WORST TEAM.  With a Home Balgona win and a strong scoring performance that title will be gifted to Laces Out...Of coarse, Home Balogna pt duex is a horrible team and will probably lose. \n-Commish Out",

    "content": "Gentleman let the playoffs begin!\nThe Ace Boog1e - Nick de Molina and God Bless the Gonk - Andrew Smith both earned themselves a bye week with 10-3 records. \nFor the first round matchups:\n(4 seed) Geno 911! - Pj O'Brien will be facing off against (5 seed) 12.5 PSI to freedom - Mike Boggiano\nThe only time they matched up this season, Geno 911! came out on top 127 to 105. That was however in week 8, when Geno 911! had a lovely 30 points from Julian Edelman (RIP).  That week 12.5 PSI also left a whopping 40 points on the bench. \nShould be a really tight match up between 2 equally delusional Jets fans. \nNow for the Game of the Week\n(3 seed....YES the 3 seed) Hoodie Cru (Billy) will be matched up against the toughest 6 seed I have ever seen - The Nasty Sack - PJ Miles. \nTo put things in perspective...Hoodie Cru's 6 game winning streak vaulted them up from worst to 3rd.  The Nasty sack scored the 2nd most points in the league (1895) only to drop to the 6th seed cause teams scored more against them than anyone else (1845). \nThese teams faced off twice this year in arguably the two best match ups of the season.  \nIn week 2 the Nasty Sack prevailed 156 to 148 even though he left 50! points on the bench. \nIn last week's play-in matchup Hoodie Cru came out on top 169 - 159 thanks to another monster Bortles performance (by the way Hoodie Cru drafted Andrew Luck with the 2nd pick of the draft....).\nThe season total for the matchups between these teams are:\nHoodie Cru - 317 over Nasty Sack 315\nThis should be an interesting week!\nCommish",

    "content": "Week 1 is in the books!\nWe saw some high scores, some low scores, some good plays and some bad plays. \nDez and Confused (139) vs. Hoodie Cru (142)\nWell Dez Bryant strikes again for Dez and Confused with an impressive 1.8 point game.  In the closest game of the week, one that was only decided by 3 points, Dez literally only needed 1 20 yard catch and it would have been game over. \nOf course Palmer only throwing TDs to Fitzgerald, and keeping Fuller (21 points) on the bench didn’t help. \n **Commissioners note – Fuller is available**\nRegardless, our Defending Champ showed grit and determination despite playing Ajayi who didn’t even put on cleats.  His Rodgers/Nelson/Crosby combo essentially guarantees him points every time Green Bay scores, after watching them this weekend, it’s looking like they’re going to be scoring a whole lot. \nWattMeWhip (160) vs. Ditka’s Revenge (185)\nWOOOOO BOYYYYY.  This was a high scoring game, and an awesome win by one of our newest members (actually the only win by one of our new members). \nEven though Ditka put up 185, he still left 44 points on the bench.  This is a strong squad.  One that was an all-star team in 2014, but non-the-less, if his old core of RB’s performs, he’ll be hard to beat with Julio eventually going beast mode on the league. \nDeangelo Williams made things interesting for WattmeWhip.  Despite scoring 35 points, he needed roughly another 100 yards and 2 touchdowns to catch Ditka. \nWorth noting the 27 points Riddick picked up this week for WattmeWhip, he was a 10th round pick and an early favorite for pick of the year. \nSack Fumblers (112) vs. Nasty Sack (105)\nThe battle of the Sacks.  Which Sack is strongest?  Whose Sack got kicked?  How many more sack puns can we come up with?  This game is the closest to a Jets/Giants type rivalry we have. A rivalry based solely on name/location and not actually playing each other. \nSack Fumblers got the win and “sack cup” this season despite a pretty horrid performance from starting QB Tyrod Taylor. \nAs we all know from the greatest football speech of all time, football is a game of inches, life is a game of inches.  If Brandon Marshal remembers how to catch the ball, Nasty Sack could have pulled out a close victory. \nStill trying to figure out how LA Rams DEF scored 9 points despite getting smoked up and down the field by the lowly 49ers. \nACE Boogie (170) vs. Knickerbockers (137)\nAfter the most devastating loss in league history, a history only 1 year in the making, ACE BOOGIE is looking to start strong this season.  Boy oh Boy did they start strong in a not as close as it seems 170 to 137 drubbing of the Knickerbockers. \nDespite Brees’ hot start for the Knickerbockers, it wasn’t enough to overcome ACE’s ridiculous lineup of skill position players (and this was a down week for ODB thanks to that vaunted cowboys D). \nGurley could have pulled the miracle from out of the hat last night, but instead pooped in the hat for a total of 5 points.  Not the kind of start you want for the top back picked. \nWorth noting Spencer Ware for Ace Boogie was a write in pick, the 201st pick of the draft and the dude scored 32 points.  Another early front runner for potential pick of the year.  We’ll see how long that lasts now that they’re expecting Charles back in the near future. \nLaces Out (179) vs Bologna (94) \nWell well well, Mr. Bologna strikes again with the lowest score of the week.  \nI want to point out to all members who are thinking about moving out west.  The two lowest scores this week were by the two teams who decided that sunshine, family and opportunity on the west coast are more important than our fantasy football league.  May this serve as a reminder to all how important it is to be at the draft live (so you don’t fall asleep chain smoking at your computer screen). \nBologna isn’t out of it yet, Wilson will rebound, Brown is an absolute football alien come to earth to destroy defenses and the rest of the team makes sense when compared to last year.  \nHe also has Brady and Denver DEF on the bench for some potential trade bait. \nWith all that said, there was nothing he could have done to stymie Laces Outs absolutely dominating performance.   Huge gambles on Cooks, Gordon, Sanu all paid off, and when you combine those guys with Big Ben, Jeffery and David Johnson…well this is a really scary team.  \nAfter an off year by Laces in 2015, 2016 looks to be a massive rebound. \n12.56 PS1 (112) vs Drinking Fortes (116)\nSometimes fantasy football gives you lemonade, sometimes it gives you devastating injuries that halt your season in its tracks week 1.  12.5 PSI lost Keenan Allen for the season, and now Demaryius Thomas might miss some time with a hip injury, two pretty big losses but there’s still hope.  Have to remember Billy was 0-6 last year before his championship turnaround. \nFor those with surplus receivers, I’m sure PSI will be listening. \nFortes’s pulled off the win thanks to Minnesota’s dominant DEF and Forte’s namesake having a rival in Jets green. He’s taking a gamble on some young high potential players (Bortles!, Landry, Austin, Lockett) but if they pan out than we’re going to be looking at a playoff team. \nODeezus 144) vs. Frites (127)\nDak who?  After the preseason drama surrounded by Ace Boogie’s questionable signing of Dak Prescott, ODeezus stuck to his guns and played Winston who rewarded him with a solid 27 point game and some serious hope for the future. \nCombining him with AJ Green and Zeke who will undoubtedly rush for 2,000 yards creates a solid core that will compete every week. \nFrites had a rough draft but after week one must be feeling pretty good about things.  Luck is back, Seattle DEF is back, and if Peterson remembers how to play football then they will be a strong contender each week. \nThis game really could have gone either way.  Frites picked up Ebron Sunday morning, didn’t play him, and he outscored the starting TE 15.6 to 0. Those 15 points wouldn’t have made up the entire difference, but ODeezus might have lucked out in this one.\nCommish",

    "content": "Week 2 recap\nWaiver Highlights\nDez and Confused picked up Tyrell Williams who is taking Keenan Allen’s snaps for the chargers. \nSack Fumblers picks up Flacco and the question everyone around the league is asking…Is he Elite?\n12.5 PSI did some work picking up Phillip Dorsett, Nelson Agholor and Eli Rodgers to fill out their WR depth.  Also looks to be stashing Dion Lewis on their IR\nLaces out picks up James Starks and Jeremy Kerley, two players you might remember from 2013\nTRADES\nDez and Confused trades Will Fuller and Isiah Crowell for 12.5 PSI’s Latavius Murray\nStandings\nThere are 4 2-0 teams, 4 0-2 teams and 6 teams tied at 1-1. \nDez and Confused ( 142) vs. WattmeWhip (114)\nSolid trade for both Dez and 12.5 PSI this week.  Dez bringing in Latavius Murray to solidify their running attack in the absence of Leveon Bell proved to be a solid move as Murray racked up 22 points.  \nDez, Edelman and Snead kept things moving along as planned leading to a 142 to 114 victory over WattmeWhip\nDez and Confused is now at 1-1 and is sitting in the final playoff spot. \nWattmeWhip had a rough week as Woodhead is now down and out for the season with a torn ACL.  \nReal tough blow to the Chargers, but with Deangelo Williams eventually finding the bench in Pittsburgh, WatchmeWhip might have some serious running back depth issues.  \nCould he be looking for a trade???\nHoodie Cru 9135) vs Frites (125)\nHoodie Cru continues his winning streak from last year which now sits at 11 games in a row with another close (or is it lucky?) win. \nHe did have a solid overall week with Rodgers, Nelson, Kelvin and Fitz doing what they do.  \nIf Luck had a decent game for Frites we’d be talking about the upset of the week, not a winning streak. \nSack Fumbler (141) vs Ditkas Revenge (176)\nDitka continues to take out his revenge on our poor league.  Once again they had the highest score, bringing their season total to a whopping 361 points (through 2 weeks!)\nHis team is just solid, Carr, Julio, Demarco, Panthers DEF...  Looking like the league will need a few of his guys to have off weeks at the same time to pull out a win. \nSack Fumblers benched Tyrod after a horrid first game, only to see him turn things around week 2 and outscore Joe “Elite” Flacco by 10 points.  Not enough to make the comeback but enough to \nconclude Tyrod is out to get him. \nKnickerbockers (132) vs Nastiest Sack (129)\nAnother close loss for Nastiest sack who has now fallen to 0-2 to start of the season (sounding eerily like last season).  This game came down to a 2 point difference, unfortunately for Nastiest Sack they left 84 points on the bench.  \nSome of those would have come in handy. \nThe question on all of our minds is why they are carrying 3 QB’s on their roster.\nKnickerbockers pulled out a nice win, their first in the league, following strong performances from Travis Benjamin and Greg Olsen.   \nLaces out (135) vs AceBoogie (140)\nBattle of the Nick’s took place this week with AceBoogie pulling out a close win despite lackluster performances from Baldwin, Abdullah and Sefarian-Jenkins. \n4 interceptions for Arizona’s DEF helped the cause, as did an instant classic from Matt Ryan. \nMelvin Gordon had another big time week, and with Woodhead going down looks to make the jump into serious RB1 conversation the remainder of the season.  We’ll see how these guys perform each week, could very well be a boom/bust kind of season. \n12.5 PSI (166) vs. Balogna (78)\n12.5 PSI’s trade for Fuller and Crowell netted him 38 points, but they each could have scored 0 and they would have ran away with the win this week.  \nDespite Denver DEF scoring 25 points for Balogna, they managed a total of 78.  To put things in perspective, Balogna DEF scored more than is 3 starting WRs and 2 starting RBs COMBINED.  \nODeezus is up next week for their free win weekend versus Balogna. \nODeezus (59) vs Drinking Fortes (153)\nWoof, Odeezus’ squad forgot to play football this weekend.  Luckily, as mentioned earlier they get Balogna next week…\nUnfortunately for ODeezus, Balonga in all of their misery still outscored them by 20 points.  This will be a barn burner. \nAs for this week, only 2 of their players scored in double figures, while Forte’s squad turned out another huge performance despite McKinnon’s 1 point (even though AP is out). \nIf Peterson missed time, Forte has a legit RB1/2 in McKinnon ready to go.  And that kids is why you handcuff talent…\nOverall\nAnother solid week all around, for those who came to the BBQ, I enjoyed your presence even if I didn’t watch a second of football.\nCommish",

    "content": "Week 3 Update\nThe league currently has 3 undefeated teams at 3-0 (AceBoogie, Drinking Fortes and Hoodie Cru).  Two of the remaining undefeated teams were in the championship last year.\nThere are also 3 totally defeated teams (Balogna, WattmeWhip and French Frites). \nThe remaining 8 teams are battling it out at either 1-2 or 2-1.  This is going to be a tight season, the final 3 or 4 playoffs spots will likely be decided by a game or two.  No one is out of it, and no one is running away with things. \nThis upcoming week sees Frites and WattmeWhip in a must win game, one of those teams will get their first win.  The other will continue their downward slide to 0-4.\nWe also have the Camden (a band they were in once upon a midnight dreary) boyz going at it with 3-0 Fortes taking on 0-3 Balgona.  Is this a rivalry game?\nNow for the games:\nDez and Confused (138) vs. Sack Fumblers (164)\nThings were looking good for Dez and Confused as they entered Monday night up 50 points.  Alas, The Sack Fumblers had 3 players in the Monday night game, and each performed far above projections with Freeman, Ingram and Fleener all going off. \nBoth teams Quarterbacks came out of the gate slow, 4th quarter comes around and Sack Fumblers Tannehill made things interesting while Dez and Confused’s Palmer threw 4 INTs.  \nHis performance would have been the worst of the week if not for the heroic showing from Fitzmagic. \nHoodie Cru (127) vs. WattmeWhip (86)\nHoodie Cru comes away with the rivalry win against baby cousin WattmeWhip.  Winning streak now sits at 12 straight games going back to last season.  When will it end??\nSomehow keeps pulling out W’s despite always having a starter that scores 0 points...  The Rodgers, Nelson, Crosby combo again comes up big. \nWattmeWhip made some questionable moves on Sunday, dropping the Bills DEF (31 points) for the Steelers (-1 point).  That 30 point swing plus the goose egg his kicker gave him crippled any hope at a victory. \nWattmeWhip has had the worst injury luck of the season with Walker, Watkins, Charles and Woodhead all missing time.  \nDeangelo Williams will be finding the bench with Bell’s return as well.  Big week next week against the lowly Frites. \nKnickerBockers (201) vs Ditkas Revenge (147)\nKncikerbockers is the first team this season to break the 200 point threshold handing Ditka their first loss of the year.  Even in defeat Ditka put up another strong week with 147 points with their RBs continuing to shoulder the load as Julio Jones continues his slow start to the year. \nTheir point total through 3 weeks sits at a staggering 508, roughly 200 points more than cellar dweller Balogna. \nKnickerbockers made some great plays this week, including the Chiefs DEF 37 point performance. \nLaces Out (101) vs Nastiest Sack (176)\nNastiest sack finally finds the win column thanks to this drubbing of Laces Out.  Marvin Jones put up 44 points, which if my calculations are correct is the highest scoring week of any player so far this season.  It also helped to have Coleman snatch 3 TD’s from Freeman Monday night. \nLaces Out will need some more help from their WR’s to keep any early season momentum alive. \n12.5 PSI (122) vs. AceBoogie (128)\n12.5 just couldn’t hold onto their lead heading into Monday night and AceBoogie picks up their 3rd win to start the season. \nMatt Ryan only picked up 19 points in this high scoring Monday night game and that was just enough to overcome 12.5 tenuous lead.  \nLooks like Ryan knew Tamme was on 12.5 PSI which caused him to seemingly avoid throwing his way the entire game. Few more catches and a handful of yards for Tamme and AceBoogie would be staring at their first loss of the season. \nRB’s for AceBoogie put up a whopping 6 points this week, they will need more out of them if they want to keep this winning streak alive. \nQuestion on all our minds is when will they trust the young gunslinger Dakota Prescott??\nODeezus (154) vs. Balogna (120)\nODeezus rebounds nicely after a horrid week 2.  Playing Balogna tends to do that for you regardless but ODeezus got great performances out of Winston, Hyde (finally) and Michael.  The 0 points from Charles Clay made no difference this week but with their other TE (Gates) still out with injury this is a serious position of need. \nBalogna put up a solid effort, picking up Pryor, prior to the game was a huge move as he scored 31 points throwing, running and catching.  Mighty be the best athlete in the NFL…not sure how many other guys can do that at the professional level. \nBrown put on another virtuoso performance scoring 26 points. He has the most targets, catches and 4th most yards this season to go along with his 2 TD’s.  Gotta imagine those numbers will remain pretty consistent this season.  \nDrinking Fortes (160) vs. French Frites (103)\nDrinking Forte’s continues their strong start to the season with a dominating 60 point win over French Frites.  \nLed by Landry, Sanders and the early season MVP – Minnesota DEF (72 total points overall – the 4th highest total score out of all players).\nWith Peterson going down for an extended period and Vereen now out for the season Frites is going to have to get really creative in their RB slots if they want to secure their first victory. \nOverall:\nNot many close games this week but slowly but surely the cream is rising to the top.  Remember this next week is the first Bye week of the season so plan accordingly.",

    "content": "Week 4 Update \nA day late, a dollar short.  This year has been a battle of the haves and have nots…\nThe standings look like oil and water.  There are currently 7 teams tied at the top at 3-1.  They are led by the Ditka juggernaut who has 100 points more than the next highest team. \nIn the middle sits 12.5 PSI who is actually well within striking distance at 2-2.\n5 teams are tied at 1-3, they will all need a solid win streak to crack the top 6 (for playoffs). \nThey say, never say never, and we all said never to last year’s champions 0-6 start…but the reality is, French Frites sitting at 0-4 might just be playing for pride at this point. \nTRADE BLOCK\nPj has made Cam Newton available – looking for a WR and RB combo \nJim has made Brady available – what are you looking for Jim?\nDez and Confused (95) vs. Knickerbockers (115)\nThis was an ugly game.  Both teams came in way below their projections. Dez couldn’t get the win despite Knickerbockers getting 0 points from both their kicker and DEF…that’s just bad. \nCrabtree’s heroic effort catching 3 TD’s single handily won this game as the rest of both teams were wallowing in their own mediocrity.  \nWith that said its not about how you win as long as you do, Knickerbockers is sitting pretty at 3-1, while Dez and Confused continues their painfully slow (and lowest margin of loss) season falling to 1-3. \nHoodie Cru (72) vs. Sack Fumbler (126)\nSack Fumbler finally put an end to Hoodie Cru’s winning streak dating back to last year. \nHoodies had their Packers contingent on bye so he was left starting Siemian, in place of Rodgers…a pretty severe drop-off there.  \nSack Fumblers cruised to victory on Flaccos’ 22, Rams DEF 18 and Ingrams 22.  \nSolid win overall, both teams now sit at 3-1 through the first 4 weeks, in great position for a playoff push. \nWattmeWhipp (109) vs. French Frites (95)\nWattmeWhip picks up their first win of the season over the lowly and French Frites.  \nFrites played a player on bye week which makes me think he’s no longer paying attention.  But the reality is he also has 2 players on IR on his bench, as well as the suspended and team less Gordon…so there weren’t many options.  \nWe all know how dire the free agency wire is these days. As commissioner I will be keeping track of this and will intervene as necessary. \nFor WattmeWhip, Cam had another down week, Charles picked up only 7 yards in his return to action and Watkins looks to be out for the season.  \nToo bad they can’t play Frites every week. \nLaces Out (121) vs. Ditka’s Revenge (179)\nDitka stomped another team this week, led by Julio Jones who only scored 1 Touchdown…oh wait he also had 300 yards and 12 catches.  His 59 points would have come close to beating Hoodie Cru’s entire team this week. \nDid I mention Ditka pulled in 0 points from their TE this week? This could have been even uglier. \nFor Laces Out, who have now lost 3 straight, there were signs of life.  Big Ben looks to be in vintage form now that Bell is back and Gordon again had a really solid game for San Diego.  \n12.5 PSI (169) vs. Nastiest Sack (116)\n12.5 PSI put on their most dominating performance, dating all the way back to last year.  They were led by Thomas, Crowell, Gore and Cincinnati DEF who all scored in the 20’s, and then of course Will Fuller who put up 30.  Steve Smith even had 27 on their bench. \nThat trade between them and Dez at the beginning of the year seems to be working quite well for one of the parties….\nNastiest Sack came in below projections as Parker, Coleman and Humphries all fell back down to earth.  \nJordan Reed carried them and he sure does look like the best TE in fantasy right now…Brady might help Gronk regain form, but Reed is an absolute beast in the redzone. \nODeezus (144) vs. AceBoogie (104)\nODeezus pulled out the big win in their rivalry game against AceBoogie. \nThey were led by AJ Green’s monster performance, Elliott’s methodical destruction of the San Fran Defense and Christine Michael's solid all-around game. \nIt wouldn’t have been enough but Aceboogie played with their heart, not their head in starting Prescott over Ryan who torched his beloved Panthers for 500 yards and 4 TDs. \nJohn brown finally had a big game after disappointing all season, but it wasn’t big enough to overcome another poor performance by OBJ (WTF is with this guy?? Sorry playing professional football, making millions of dollars and banging super models isn’t fun for you anymore..).\nDrinking Forte’s (127) vs. Home Balogna (144)\nHome Balogna pulled out his first victory of the season against rival, Drink Forte. \nWhat a win it was with Wilson, Brown and Denver DEF all putting up 20+. Brady is back, and apparently he’s looking to trade.  We’ll see, might be a better player than Wilson.  \nForte needs more out of the 1st overall pick, Gronk if they want to keep their early season fortunes alive and well.  Drafting Howard for the Bears was once panned across the league, but with Langford going down for the foreseeable future, Howard is a RB2 lock and low tier RB1.   Between him and McKinnon Forte is riding high on handcuffs. \nThat’s it for this week, we’ll see how things progress.  \nDez and Confused and Laces out are playing a huge game to each avoid starting 1-4.  \nHome bologna is matched up against French Frites in a matchup of the two lowest scoring teams. \nMore important games are between Hoodie Cru and Knickerbockers, and Drinking Fortes and Aceboogie.  All 4 teams are sitting at 3-1 right now.",

    "content": "Fantasy Week 5\nGetting a little bored trying to put a positive spin on all your great wins as my team continues its steady path into the gutter so I’m taking a note from my idol Matthew Berry and writing a 10 Things I Hate About Fantasy Football style column.  This week’s preview at the end. \n1.  Sammie Coates..I hate Sammie Coates.  Spot started against me not only in this league but also in my work league.  He scored more on the first play of the game than he did in any other game this season.  He scored more in the game than he did in every other week combined this season.  I hate him, once he burned the Jets I knew I was on my way to my 3rd straight loss. \n2. Every week there are 5 guys on the free agency wire that put up 20+ points.  I think of the first 10 TD’s scored on Sunday, 7 or 8 of them belong to guys not owned by anyone.  Bullshit, I hate it.  If they aren’t on a fantasy roster why do they even play football?\n3. Don’t want to make this all about me, but our lopsided schedules are just the worst.  I have .12 more points total than ODeezus, yet he sits pretty at 4-1. \n4. All projections.  Where do they come up with this stuff?  \n5. First Round Picks.  Of the 14 guys taken in the first round of our draft this year only Brown, Julio, Green and Johnson have even come close to their lofty status.  Gronk has been out, Dez has been out, Cam has been out, Peterson is gone.  Experts are dumb, we’re dumb, and injuries are dumb.\n6. I hate Running Backs.  Of the top 50 scorers in all of fantasy this season, only 10 are RB’s… To make matters worse, 1 of those 10 was picked in the 1st round and 3 were taken in the second.  This is a lose lose situation.  You need to draft RB early cause there aren’t many good ones..but then only 4 of the 10 taken in our first two rounds are performing with any consistency… Oh, and what the fuck is with these RB committees featuring 3 guys?? 2 dudes splitting carries were enough.  \n***Rules committee potential vote – Scrap all positions and make every slot on the roster FLEX except QB, K, DEF??????\n7. I hate Ditka’s Revenge.  Of the 16 players in fantasy who have scored more than 100 points so far this season he has 4 of them.  Oh, and he has a guy at 98 points total.  But I digress, this isn’t a personal hate column. \n8. I already mentioned how I hate projections, but I also hate averages.  How many of you have said this to yourself “He averages 10 a game!  That’s not bad considering there’s no one on the waiver wire!  Oh…wait…he scored 30 one game, and then 3 in the following 3 games total…”  I think the better stat, the stat we all need, is a consistency rating.  Putting together the formula now as I’m already preparing for next year’s draft. \n9. 2 Defenses being in the top 25 point scorers in all of fantasy.  That means they both should have been drafted in the first 2 rounds.  I stand by our defensive scoring rules, but wish I drafted one before the last round. \n10.  Losing.  Each week brings new hope, new projections which validate drafting that player a round too early, preparing your trash talking texts to your weeks opponent… All to just watch your best player go down in the first quarter, your QB throw that dreaded pick 6, that defense you’re going against return a fumble and block a punt… You delete your texts… you close your apps… you swear off fantasy… you start watching Pitch Perfect 2… and then you realize the Dallas Cowboys are 4-1 and everything is right in the world after all. \nThis week’s games:\nBig week of games headlined by the ODeezus (4-1) vs. Ditka (4-1) match up.  Both are well positioned, but this will be a game of bragging rights and leader board domination. \nSpeaking of unbalanced schedules to start the year.  Our 3 other 4-1 teams (Knickerbockers, Sack Fumblers and Drinking Fortes) are all playing teams with a 1-4 record.  WE NEED SOME UPSETS GUYS!!!!\nDrinking Forte's is playing brother from the same mother, Nasty Sack in the first of 2 blood brother match-ups this season (ODeezus vs Dez will be later on).\nThe big season saving game might be between Dez and Confused (1-4) and 12.5 PSI (2-3), both need a win in a big way to stay afloat. \nGood Luck and God speed, may all your starters go down with injuries.\nCommish",

    "title": "Week 7 Recap",
    "content": "Things are starting to fall into place in the standings after an exciting Week 6. The playoffs as of today would include 3 5-1 teams and 3 4-2 teams. \nFrench Frites picked up their first win of the season, Ditka’s revenge somehow lost again and both ODeezus and Knickerbockers continue to roll with their 4 and 5 game winning streaks. \nBig trade went down this week.  Hoodie Cru sent Jordy Nelson and his touchdown per week average to the Sack Fumblers for a DEF, a rookie WR and hopefully a blowjob.  I really thought about vetoing this trade, but given I’ve already played Sack Fumblers, and have no desire to see Hoodie Cru win another championship I bit my tongue. \nIf you’re interested in doing a fantasy basketball league. Here is a link to one I just set up.  Thinking 8-10 teams, $20 a person, auction draft.  If we have the numbers we’ll do it, if you have friends interested than send them the link. \nhttps://yho.com/nba?l=109667&k=03a699e1e8430313...\nWeek 7 matchups\nDez and Confused (1-5) vs Odeezus (5-1)\nOur last blood brother matchup of the season taking place this week.  Dez again needs a win, but it’s been 4 weeks in a row where a win was needed and nowhere to be found.  Luckily the Cowboys are on bye so ODeezus doesn’t have half his team this week. \nHoodie Cru (3-3) vs 12.5 PSI (3-3)\nHuge game for potential playoff positioning.  One of these team will find themselves a game over .500 at the half way point of the season. \nWattmeWhip (1-5) vs. Laces Out (3-3)\nTough game for WattmeWhip without Cam playing this week.  He’ll be looking for Stafford to match last week’s 4 TD performance. Still might not be enough to overcome Laces Out’s David Johnson who in my eyes is the mid-season MVP so far. \nSack Fumblers (4-2) vs Knickerbockers (5-1)\nAfter last week’s loss to the winless Frites, Sack Fumblers pulled off another major trade.  Over the last 2 weeks, he has turned Freeman, Fleener and Shepard into Jordy Nelson and Tom Brady….not bad at all!  Early season vote for GM/Executive of the year.  \nThis week he puts his newly formed team up against the Knickerbockers, who have won 5 straight after dropping their first game. They have a sneaky good team, and if Gurley picks things up in the second half of the season will be primed to make a serious run. \nDrinking Fortes (5-1) vs. Ditkas Revenge (4-2)\nBig game between two of the top teams in the league.  Forte’s will hope Gronk continues to Gronk on everyone and Ditka will need to be creative replacing both their K and DEF who are on bye this week. \nBalogna (2-4) vs. Nastiest Sack (1-5)\nWest coast battle.  Nastiest Sack continues their poor start to the season while Balogna is back down to earth after they had their 2 game win streak snapped last week. Tough call leaving Ajayi on the bench last week costing him the game. \nAceBoogie (4-1) vs. French Frites (1-5)\nFrites was the last team to enter the win column last week but did so in style with huge games from a few of their players.  None of those players had as big of a game as ODB did for AceBoogie last week, he put up 48 points.  The guy might suck but he is pretty damn good.\n\nLast week I decided to focus my energy on the team and not the write up.  Thought it was a critical week and needed a win.  Well, I made all the wrong plays, so we’re back to the weekly write up routine as this is all I have going for me at this point. \nThis week we’ll be reviewing each team’s playoff likelihood now that we are a mere 5 games away from week one of the playoffs. \nTIER 1 - NEAR LOCKS – Would likely need to lose 3 or 4 of the remaining games to miss the playoffs\nKnickerBockers (6-2):\nReally solid team, comes through each week.  Brees/Hilton is a great combo, Olsen’s still got it, Crabtree has really broken out, and Gurley though not spectacular has been consistent at the RB spot which is really all you can ask for these days.  \nDrinking Forte’s (6-2):\nBortles, Bortles, Bortles.  Sitting there watching that game unfold and he’s completely unable to even through a 15 yard out route.  Turn the game off, and he puts up 30 against me in garbage time.  Might be the perfect fantasy QB (he did lead Billy to victory last season) because you don’t need to draft him and he will undoubtedly break the back of whoever you’re playing week in week out. \nIt’s not just Bortles though, the Gronk stash is seriously paying off, Sanders/Landry put up scores in the teens each week, Forte has come alive and his duo of handcuffs (McKinnon/Howard) are doing some big things.  \nTIER 2 – SOLID POSITIONING – No real cause for concern these teams – other than catastrophic injuries\nDitka’s Revenge (5-3):\nDerek Carr has been awesome, Julio and Mike Evans each get seemingly 20 targets a game, McCoy, Demarco, Blount are arguably the 3 best backs in fantasy.  \nSurprising this team lost 3 games, but of those 3 losses, he had 201 points against, 161 points against, and 141 points against.  Arguably the best weeks for each of those 3 teams came against Ditka. \nLaces Out (5-3):\nAfter a 1-3 start, Laces Out has rolled off 4 straight wins (longest active win streak) bringing them up to 5-3 and comfortably in playoff position. \nHe’s been riding David Johnson (best player in fantasy) and Melvin Gordon while Big Ben has been out.  It does look like Ben will be back this week which will be a huge plus to an already high scoring team. \nCooks has been really solid during the win streak and Jeffery seems to be happy Cutler is back under center.  How long can this streak last?\nThe AceBoogie (5-3):\nHuge season from Matt Ryan and Amari Cooper have led the scoring for Ace this year.  Spencer Ware has picked things up the last few weeks on his campaign for pick of the season. \nODB has been kind of a boom or bust play, but when he booms he booms – his 48 point game a few weeks ago is the reason he was one of the first picks of the draft. \nTIER 3 – THINGS ARE GETTING SCARY\nODeezus (5-3)\nDespite their 5-3 record, ODeezus has dropped their last 2 games, and in a league with 9 teams at or above .500, ODeezus needs to break this slump ASAP. \nLuckily Ezekial Elliott is capable of anything. \nHoodie Cru (5-3)\nDespite being the lowest scoring team in the league with a meager 926 points (top score is 1248…) Hoodie Cru’s deal with the devil dating back to last season has them sitting at 5-3 with 2 straight wins. \nDon’t buy it.  Trading Nelson is still a complete mystery to me, Rodgers is having a down year.  Benjamin goes as Cam goes, and Cam hasn’t been going like Cam this season.  Most consistent guy is Fitzgerald, who is like 45 years old and on a surprisingly bad offense.  \nWinter is coming for Hoodie Cru\nSack Fumblers (4-4)\nAfter all their wheeling and dealing Sack Fumblers have managed to drop 3 straight games. \nThis week they have a huge match up with 12.5 PSI, the only other 4-4 team.  This is a make or break week. One where both Hopkins and Brady are on bye. \nTIER 4 – STRIKING POSITION\n12.5 PSI to Freedom (4-4)\nSlowly but surely 12.5 PSI has climbed themselves out of the basement.  Last week’s heroic effort against Watt me Whip (back and forth 146-144 victory) might just be the launching pad PSI needs this week against Sack Fumblers. \nBad week to be rolling with Josh McCown as their starting QB, but even the Browns have to gain SOME yards each week…\nTIER 5 – FEEL GOOD STORIES\nFrench Frites (3-5)\nWho saw this coming?  I sure didn’t… After a rough draft, some questionable early season acquisitions and brutal luck (Peterson going down, Luck forgetting how to play football), Frites has turned things around with a 3 game winning streak. \nHome Balogna pt Deux (3-5)\nWell, well, well Balogna.  You’ve sure made this commissioner eat his words from earlier in the season.  Great pickups of Chris Hogan, Pryor Sr and Jay Ajayi bolster solid starters Devonta Freeman and Antonio Brown. \nMight be too late this season, but there is hope that next year’s Balogna edition won’t leave the draft with 2 K, 2 DEF and 3 TE’s again. \nTIER 6 – BETTER LUCK NEXT YEAR\nNasty Sack (2-6):\nAnother unlikely season for Nasty Sack – that’s 2 years in a row where the draft looks good, the roster moves look right, and the wins don’t come. \nWATTmeWhip (1-7):\nLeague isn’t the same without its top trash talker winning any games.  Maybe he’ll revisit the QB with the second pick of the draft strategy next year. \nDEZ AND CONFUSED (2-6):\nWell isn’t this bitter sweet for you all.  Looks like DEZ has put too much effort into draft parties and weekly write ups this year.  \nJust one of those years for your trusty Commish…If you check Yahoo’s power rankings, Dez and Confused is comfortably in first place.  That has not translated week to week despite great projections and solid depth, fantasy football remains the bain of my existence. \nChanges coming next year, watch out.\n\nNot much to say this week so I'm going to keep it brief.  Next week we might have the first of teams being locked into spots.  \n6 teams tied at 6-3, all in playoff positioning. \n2 teams at 5-4, on the door step\n2 teams at 4-5, hope is still alive. \nAfter this week we can legit have 10 teams within striking distance of the playoffs.  This is getting interesting.  Good luck all.\n\nIn the unfortunate scenario where I do not win the championship...payouts will be as follows:\n$1100 to 1st place\n$200 to 2nd place\n$100 to 3rd place\nPayments will be made via Venmo at the final whistle of week 16 (Xmas Eve).  For one of you this will be a VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS\nIf you plan to try and make some sort of deal, to split the pot, that is your own prerogative, but again, payments will be made upon completion of ALL games. This is a way to keep competitive spirit alive the final (most important) week.  Let the champion win $1100 and send half of that to the team they just beat out of the kindness of their heart.\n\nYUGE matchups this week.  This is now do or die for a lot of teams. \nLet’s hit some of the highlights from around the league and then take a look ahead at this week’s matchups. \nLaces out is continuing their scorching win streak which now rests at 6 games.  They were 1-3 at one point this season, I remember it well because that was the week I played him…\nDespite their win streak, they still find themselves in 2nd place thanks in large part to Ditka’s massive scoring totals. \nOdeezus continues to ride Zeke to the promise lands. \nHoodie Cru’s deal with the devil has continued with a staggering 4 game win streak despite scoring the second fewest points in the league this year. Can this last?  Can he be a repeat champion?\nKnickerbockers and Fortes, if you remember from my write up weeks ago were “Near Locks.”  Well, in the time since they’ve gone on 3 and 2 game losing streaks respectively.  So that near lock prediction, similar to all predications in fantasy this season was completely and totally off. \n12.5 PSI, Sack Fumblers, and AceBoogies all find themselves at .500 through the first 10 weeks of the season.  With only 6 playoffs spots – all of which are filled with teams currently over .500 – time is running out. \nDez and Confused is riding high after their first back-to-back victories.  If matchups break the right way and they win out you could be looking at a dangerous 6 seed. \nFrench Frites, Balogna, Watt and Nasty are all but out of the race for the playoffs.  Even with incredible luck they likely won’t have the points needed to break any kind of tie-breaker scenario. But keep your pride up boys!  Play spoiler! Win the upset! Your wins will not be forgotten \nWeek 11 Match Ups:\n8 of the 9 teams at or above .500 are playing each other this week.  This not only has playoff seeding implications on the line, but the reality of missing the playoffs entirely. \nHoodie Cru (7-3) vs. AceBoogie (5-5)\nHoodieCru looks to keep their magic alive.  A loss will likely have them tumbling out of playoff positioning.  Ace needs the win after 2 straight losses if they hope to make any sort of run this season. \nSack Fumblers (5-5) vs. Drinking Fortes (6-4)\nBoth teams are coming off of tough losses and jockeying for positioning.  Looking like 5th seed is their ceiling. \nKnickerbockers (6-4) vs. ODeezus (7-3)\nODeezus can really separate from the pack with a win this week. Knickerbockers has lost 3 straight since this commissioner blessed them with “near lock” certainty.  Despite a tough few weeks their high point total buys some leeway.  \nLaces Out (7-3) vs. 12.5 PSI (5-5)\nLet’s see if Laces Out can keep the streak alive and extend to 7 straight wins.  Alshon Jeffrey suspension really could not have come at a worse time for him.  12.5 needs another win this week to keep their playoff probability above dumb luck. \nOther games are happening this week, and their important in their own ways but will not likely affect the playoff situation.\nGood luck this week, I hope teams 1-9 all lose.\n\nWhat a week of upsets!  I'll be writing up a more detailed preview for next weeks games later this week when the standings shake out. \nEveryone is welcome to come over this Sunday for football (12/4).  Its the last week of the fantasy regular season, and playoff spots WILL BE ON THE LINE.  Let's watch together!\nDez and Confused continued their scorching stretch, putting up 184 against Ditka's revenge. \nHoodie Cru's luck has taken another hit, with an inevitable loss to last place Nastiest Sack this week. \nWattmeWhip came up huge, knocking Aceboogie to 6-6. \nHome Bologna put on arguably their best performance of the season and are well on their way to beating the Sack Fumblers\nLaces out continues their win streak by squeaking by (reeling?) ODeezus\n12.5 PSI and Frites are going at in in the worst fantasy match up of the year.  \nThe only meaningful match up that still has consequences is knickerbockers Vs. Fortes.  Knick is down 8 points with Sproles going tonight.  A win for Knick secures his playoff spot.  A loss for Fortes all but eliminates him.\n\nWhat season!  \nCongrats to everyone for making this one of the most competitive fantasy leagues I’ve ever seen.  \nCongrats to our new league members, 2 of the 3 are going to the playoffs.  \nThis final week will go down in our history books.  There are 7 teams fighting for the final 3 playoff spots – 3 of them are within 20 points of each other so every yard, catch, and TD will have an impact.  \nI can’t wait to see how the final week and playoffs pan out, and I can’t wait to run it back next year for year 3. \nLet’s walk through scenarios for each team still in the running. \nLaces Out\n8 game win streak brought them from 1-3 to 9-3.  Best running game in the league.  They’ve already clinched the bye week heading into the playoffs, but one more win means they lock up the 1st seed and a 2016 fantasy award.\nDitka’s Revenge and Knickerbockers\nBoth teams clinched the playoffs, one will have a bye week next week when the playoffs start.  If it goes to points tie breaker than Ditka has the bye.  If Ditka loses and Knickerbockers wins than Knickerbockers has the bye.  \nODeezus\nSitting at 7-5, a win this week clinches a playoff spot.  No AJ Green for the stretch run will be tough to overcome, but with Zeke anything is possible.  Just keep feeding him. Match up against PSI has playoff implications. \nHoodie Cru\nThis is a huge week for the luckiest team in the league.  A win guarantees a playoff spot.  A loss (their 3rd straight) will likely drop them from the playoffs all together based on point tie breakers.  Really tough match up against the highest scoring team in the league this week – Ditka’s Revenge.\nDez and Confused\nWell looky here.  Riding a dominating 4 game win streak, and high point totals (3rd in the league) a win will guarantee at least the 6th seed.  Based on how ODeezus and Hoodie Cru do this week they can jump to 4th place.  By the way, 4 weeks ago they were in 13th place at 2-6.  They control their own destiny with a win and have been playing do-or-die playoff football for the last 4 weeks.  They have the lowly French Frites this week.\nSack Fumblers and The Ace Boogie\nUntimely losses last week to two of the bottom dwellers kept them from being comfortable this week.  They each need a loss from one of 3 teams (Dez and Confused, Hoodie Cru, ODeezus) and a high scoring week to have a chance at a playoff spot. Interestingly enough, they play each other this week, after completing a trade with each other at the end of last week.  Will that affect the outcome??  HUGE MATCH UP.  One team has a chance, the other is done. \n12.5 PSI\nStill in this thing, if they manage a high scoring win against ODeezus, and a low scoring outcome of Sack Fumblers Vs. Aceboogie they can make the playoffs.  With a revolving door of WR’s who will get this critical start?\nDrinking Fortes\nFrom 2nd in the league to 10th in the league in a matter of weeks Drinking Fortes is all but done. That’s what a 4 game losing streak will do to you.  That’s what drafting Gronk with the second pick (instead of David Johnson, Zeke, Julio, ODB, etc.) will do to you during crunch time.  Gronk is obviously one of the best players in the league but getting harder and harder to trust. \nWattmeWhipp – Home Balonga – French Frites – Nastiest Sack\nThere’s always next year!  Some of your wins the last few weeks made this Commish VERY happy.  Well done, and I salute you for keeping at it despite insurmountable odds!\n\nPlayoff Football is in full swing. \nLast weeks wins/losess and tiebreakers left us with a solid final 6 teams. 2 new members, and 2 O'Donnell brothers made the playoffs.\n1. Ditka's Revenge\n2. Laces Out\n3. Knickerbockers\n4. DEZ and CONFUSED\n5. Sack Fumblers\n6. ODeezus \nAs for this week's wildcard round.  DEZ and CONFUSED is all but assured of a victory after Laveon Bell went spacejam MONSTARS on the Bills for arguably the best fantasy game of the season.  Rounded out by the superb pickup and play of ATL DEF, DEZ and Confused will be moving on. \nWell done Sack Fumblers, great season, good draft, some solid pickups and great trades made you a formidable opponent week in week out. \nThe other matchup this week is coming down to Monday Night Football.  Both ODeezus and Knickerbockers had down weeks and left some points on the board. \nWith ODeezus up 1 point heading into the game tonight this will get interesting.  Both have players going for the Pats.  Will they kick field goals (Gostkowski - Knickerbockers) or score TD's with their rookies (Mitchell - ODeezus). \nEither way, one team will be moving on to the final 4. \nWill have a preview of semi-finals later in the week. \nCommish",

Commish vs. Newbie.  Pass Catchers vs. Ball Runners. \nThese teams faced off in week 12, with DEZ coming out on top 184 to 143.  That was arguably the most important game of DEZ's season and their team came through, will they again?  Will Ditka exact the Revenge he's been hinting at all season?\nGraham already put up a dud on Thursday night, so DEZ is behind the at ball a bit. \nWill Julio Jones play?  How will McCoy and Bell fare in snowy weather (hopefully just as well as last week!)?  Will Cam turn things around?\nA lot of football to be played to decide this one. \nLaces Out vs. ODeezus\nLaces is coming off the bye after riding a 9 game win streak to secure the top seed. \nWeek 12 (do week 12 matchups = semi finals???) saw Laces Out come out on top in a close game 129-122. \nLast week ODeezus pulled off the upset on the back of Powel and Hyde. \nDoes Gordon play for Laces?  How come the other playoff teams didn't lock up his handcuff in Farrow? Does Alshon play coming off his roid suspension? Does AJ Green play??

The fact that I had multiple messages from multiple people before 8am this morning in regards to the Waiver wire speaks to the quality of this league and it's owners. \nHere's the week 1 recap!!\nDez 135 - Hoodie 83\nDez and Confused came out strong in week 1, picking up where they left off last season as one of the hottest teams in the league.  Of course, these are totally different rosters so the similarities pretty much end there.  Carried by top 2 picks Zeke Elliot and Todd Gurley (whose laughing now) and dominant performances by their 2nd and 3rd to last picks (Pit DEF + Gold Jacket Witten).  Alls good on the front despite losing admitted longshot Kevin White for the season (welp thats the end of his career).   \nHoodie Cru got off to their typical slow start to the season, what else is new.  Thing about Hoodie cru is that luck is somehow always on his side.  Rodgers put in a pedestrian performance and ODB (his first rounder) didn't play.  He left some points on the board by not getting Kupp in his starting lineup for the injured ODB, but that wouldn't have been enough to overcome Dez's overall team win. \nWattmeWhip 125 - Ditka 88\nWattmeWhip cruised to victory on another virtuoso performance from Antonio Brown.  Question has to be asked…is he the greatest fantasy player of all time?  When 11 cathces and 180 yards seems normal, you have to ask.  Putting up 125 points in week 1 is no easy feet, and to do so without Gronk and Gillislee (who played Thursday) is all the more impressive.  After a tough 2 seasons for WattmeWhip, it looks like he finally has a team that can not only contend, but be a front runner.\nDitka's Revenge was unsuccessful in avoiding a Championship Hangover.  Did the Boos get to him??  He needed big games from Hilton (no QB), Marshall (no ODB) and Eifert (is Dalton the new flacco?) and received a shit sandwich instead.  Lucky to have Carolina DEF otherwise this would have been really ugly. \nSack Fumblers 136 - Knickerbockers - 70\nFantasy is Pain.  Pain is Fantasy.  May the joy of having the 1st pick of the draft turn to ashes in your mouth within 24 hours.  The debate of Johnson/Bell/Brown seemed like a no-brainer to many of us only 2 days ago…Now, let's just say, Sack Fumblers needs to get creative.   Despite it all, a week 1 win must come as a sigh of relief.  A solid overall draft carried him this week, but what happens over the next few as DJ's 20 point average continues to be a memory of 2016?\nKnickerbockers could be in trouble if Wilson doesn't snap out of it ASAP.  His veteran core provides a solid floor, but where is the gamebreaker?  Where is the guy who shocks the world? Could be Shepard, he looked good last night despite no ODB.  More will be needed from vets Peterson, Olsen and Decker. \nLaces out 138 - Nastiest Sack 112\nLaces out and Nastiest Sack picked up right where they left off last season.  That is, with Laces out winning another game, scoring more than enough points.  And of course, our Toliet Trophy recipient kicked off another season with a solid score yet no win.  \nLaces rode big games from his two first 2 picks, McCoy and Gordon, forming one of the top runningback tandems in the league.  A big game from Tate and a monster DEF performance sealed the deal. \nNastiest Sack put up a respectable score, with their players averaging 10 points each..Consistency, as valuable as it is, isn't enough to win this league - he'll need some big plays and big games from his guys.\n2 Gurley 158 - AceBoogie 82\nDominating win this week for 2 Gurleys 1 Kupp who will be recieving our first ever WEEKLY SCORING CHAMPION PRIZE.  He was led by the LAR DEF, Jordy (who looks better than ever) and masterful pick of Wentz late in the draft. Is this the year Diggs breaks out?  With Pryor, McCaffrey and Lynch in the fold this team is built for both long and short term success. \nDon't let this week 1 loss fool you.  The ACEBoogie is solid all around - unable to play Hill and Ajayi this week (2 of his top picks) a win this week was always a long shot.  With Brees under center, J Stew getting goalline carries and Dez looking liked Dez (despite a lackluster week 1) they will be a team to keep an eye on moving forward. \nBalogna 111 - Odezus 87\nMassive leap forward for Balogna this year - after a solid and rather un-Balogna like draft, smart plays of Coleman and Blount - Balogna cruised to a week 1 victory of Odeezus\nOdeezus was burned by Hurricane Irma canceling the TB game so he rode without a DEF.  Unfortunately this isn't the Balogna team of past years. He needs much more from Benjamin and Henry - two players poised for breakouts.  Doug Martin can't come back from suspension fast enough.  In a short season every win counts and this one slipped away for ODezus \nForte 86 - JetSetters 82\nIn the ugliest and closet game of the week, Drinking Forte came out on top of newcomer JetSetters.\nNo Mike Evans for Forte cou,d have spelled disaster, but the pick of Austin Hooper could be a game breaker for Fortes as he has Kelce on the bench.  Trade bait?  Dez's TE techniqu of 2016?  Hard to tell at this stage, but solid win overall. \nNew comer JetSetters always knew this week was a long shot.  Drafting Kareem Hunt came with week 1 risk, but season long upside. Having 3 QBs on the roster seems silly...especially when the one that was played scored only 1 point.  Does look like he has another rookie runner in Cook that can make a difference going forward.\n\nAnother tough week for NFL Offenses…\nWattMeWhip 133 Vs Dez and Confused 108\nDez isn’t going to win many games when Zeke has less than 10 yards rushing so no surprise here that WattmeWhip came away with their 2nd win of the season.  Garbage time TD’s from a pair of Jags proved enough to put them over the top.  We’ll see if Gronk plays this coming week but seeing him go down in week 2 must have been a heart stopper\nHoodie Cru 130 Vs Knickerbockers 112\nHoodie cru cruised to their 1st win of the season on the back of Crabtree who single handedly torched the Jets. His 2$ waiver claim of Thompson (Redskins back) is early season favorite for best pickup.  He really flashed last week - lets see if it lasts. OBJ is great, but this is starting to look more and more like Eli’s fall from grace. \nTheres no other way to put this…Knickerbockers is in trouble.  Peterson is a shell of his former self and the saints don’t seem to give a shit about what he thinks/says.  Olsen broke his foot and is out 6-8 weeks.  He’s a big man, so getting back on the field might be easier said than done. Moves will need to be made otherwise playoffs will be a memory of 2016 for the Knickerbockers. \nSack Fumblers 144 Vs. JetSetters 129\nSack Fumblers picks up a critical 2nd win despite not having David Johnson. Their pick up of Cohen at 47$ seems a bit high after week 2, but the kid is talented so we’ll see. \nFor JetSetters another huge week from Hunt who is looking like the early season MVP so far.  Playing Bradford, who was scratched was clearly a mistake - but the only QB remaining was Jarred Goff and his 12 point performance wouldn’t have been enough to overcome Sack Fumblers\nLaces Out 160 Vs. ODeezus 122\nLaces out wins week 2’s high score $50 bills - Congrats!  \nThey continue to roll - Brady, Adams, Gordon, Sanders all went off, McCoy had a slow week but once he gets going Laces Out will be a formidable opponent week in week out.  Bal DEF after 2 straight 20+ week performances is somehow an early season MVP candidate. \nODeezus continues their slide with poor performances out of Murray (…this could be D Henry’s year…) Rawls and Bernard. Potentially missing on 3/4 starting RB’s is more or less a death sentence for ODeezus if his guys don’t turn it around. They need Dougie Martin to come back ASAP and in his 2015 pre-rehab form. \nNastiest Sack 136 Vs. 2 Gurley’s 1 Kupp 102\nWoof, this week was a fall from grace for 2 Gurleys.  Looks like they avoided a serious injury for Jordy but he’s still 50/50 for next week. They spent a lot of $$ on waivers last week - lets see if it pays off. \nNastiest Sack gets a huge win on the back of James White and Alshon Jeffery.  Once CIN starts scoring again (with AJ Green) this will be a solid team. \nDrinking Forte 125 Vs. Home Bologna 112\nDrinking Forte won the annual Camden Bowl (a band with classics such as “Mexico”, “Don’t Care” and “Country Class”) \nDrinking Forte’s Mike Evans is LEGIT - huge game for him as well as Kelce who literally flew 5+ yards into the end zone this weekend\nBologna had solid but un-spectacular scores from nearly their entire team.  Corey Coleman is out for the season now so moves will need to be made.  \nAce boogie 106 vs. Cutlets Bottom 71\nThis was an ugly matchup that Aceboogie comes out of with a cheap win (3rd lowest score this week).  Dez had a solid game despite the cowboys looking like a steaming pile of garbage and Brees racked up points despite his defense being completely manhandled by a Pats team that played WR’s that literally no one has ever heard of. \nCutlets Bottom made ALL the wrong moves, with pretty much everyone on his bench outscoring their respective starters.  That first round pick of Jordan Howard is looking worse and worse with each passing week.\n\nSome of you might have noticed changes to the schedule...\nI was looking ahead at future weeks and noticed I was playing Hoodie Cru twice this season...\nThat caused me to look into schedules on the back end and sure enough, Yahoo has us going against only 12 teams, rather than 13, with 1 matchup being played twice. \nThats not how we roll so I began tinkering with the schedule to ensure we each play eachother once. \nNeedless to say, I now know why it takes so long for NBA/NFL to create and release schedules..it is a serious pain in the ass. \nI'm close to completing, just wanted to give a heads up. \nI think I need to tell my work to take away a day of Paid time Off because this is literally the only thing I've been working on this morning.",

    "content": "Fantasy week 3 write up - Next week we'll be trying a slightly different write-up format, starting to get into the groove so the creative juices are flowing...\nDez and Confused 165 Vs. Laces Out 132\nDez and confused made the selfish and foolish call to bench Larry Fitzgerald this week who was matched up against his beloved Cowboys.  Playing Fitzgerald would have meant that Dez had the highest score and an extra $50…Lucky for Dez Fitz wasn’t needed to knock Laces Out off their pedestal with a convincing win. \nNo worries though for Laces out who would have beaten a number of other team this week.  Looking forward to the inevitable playoff matchup between these two clubs.\n2 Gurleys 1 Kupp 126 Vs. Hoodie Cru 121\nClose game between two league veterans.  Hoodie Cru’s studs (Rodgers, OBJ) came to play and the pick up of Thompson is looking more and more like a lock for “Best Pickup”\nDespite it all it wasn't enough to overcome 2 Gurleys in the closest matchup of the week. \nI bet 2 Gurley’s wish they had their namesake but will settle with Jordy, Diggs and McCaffrey blasting opponents each week.\nWattmeWhip 121 Vs. Sack Fumblers 103\nSack Fumblers rolled the dice with no Kicker this week and it did not pay off…Granted not many kickers are going to have 20 point performances, so even with one a victory would have been slim. \nWattmeWhip continues their winning streak and is now the lone undefeated team in the league, sitting pretty at 3-0.  First 3 picks of Brown, Fournette and Gronk are looking really good.  Matt Ryan is leading the best offense in football.  Wattme is here to stay\nJetSetters 171 Vs. Odeezus 58\nCongrats to JeTsetters for their first league win and it came in spectacular fashion, putting up a whopping 171 to collect the $50 weekly winner.  Cook and Hunt form one of the top RB pairings in the league, and by far the best rookie RB pairing. \nOdeezus…my god…58 points (Dez had more after Thursday night)…with Demarco murray scoring most of his 21points on a single play…Not many bright spots here - could a toilet be their future?\nNastiest Sack 152 Vs. Drinking Forte 117\nIn the first of two brother vs. brother match-ups this season, Big bro Nastiest Sack came away with a dominating win.  AJ Green finally came through, Cooks might be the best Pats receiver since Moss and Dak put on a show. \nForte needs way more than 1 point from Kelce if they want to stay on the right side of .500.  Hyde and Thomas both performed - as Evans gets in a groove and they solidify their FLEX spots Drinking Fortes will contend\nHome Bologna 129 Vs. AceBoogie 116. \nHome Balongna heads to 2-1 after a comfortable win over AceBoogie.  A better game from Dez (why don’t they move him around the field?  Like..At all?) could have pulled off the upset. \nBologna is looking solid this year despite needing Cam to look like the Cam from 2 years ago.\nCutlet’s bottom 138 Vs. Knickerbockers 119. \nCutlets Bottom, our defending Champ, got themselves in the win column after taking down the lowly Knickerbockers. Bad news wasn’t too far behind as it looks like Eifert is now going to be out for a few weeks (again). \nKnickerbockers left 60 points on their bench by opting for cutler over wilson, decker over shepard and gates over engram…Its not all about drafting the players, its about putting them in a position to win you games \nTill next week, \nCommish",

    "title": "Standings Update",
    "content": "A rule I read about in Matt Berry's column today.  Find it pretty interesting...would have to go completely offline to make it happen though so it's out of the question:\n\"I've mentioned this before, but a rule I've played with (in a league we kept by hand) was the potential for two wins every week: one head-to-head against your opponent and another for the top five scorers (assuming a 10-team league) in a given week. So every week you either go 2-0, 1-1 or 0-2. That evens out good or bad teams being helped or hurt by scheduling.\"\n\nStandings are starting to take shape and there are some surprises currently in line for the playoffs. \n1 - Dez and Confused - RB heavy and versatile attack.  Poised for the playoffs, with or without Zeke. \n2 - 2 Gurleys 1 Kupp - Deep team led by the top WR tandem in the league (Nelson + Diggs) through the 1st 4 weeks. \n3 - Home Bologna - Amazing start to the year and Congrats on weekly scoring prize!\n4 - WattmeWhip - strong record thanks to teams missing their projected total (2nd fewest points against in the league).  In need of RB (trades anyone?)\n5 - Drinking Fortes - less points for (453) than points against (456) yet sitting at 3-1.  Fools Gold?\n6 - Nastiest Sack - Most points scored through 4 weeks (555).  A strong 2-2 to start the season. \nThrough the first 4 weeks, lets take a look at how our first round draft picks are stacking up. You know who you picked.  Fantasy is a crapshoot...\n1 - David Johnson - Current rank: 322\n2 - Le’Veon Bell - Current rank: 12\n3 - Antonio Brown - Current rank: 14\n4 - Julio Jones - Current rank: 87\n5 - AJ Green - Current rank: 26\n6 - Odell Beckham - Current rank: 73\n7 - Mike Evans - Current rank: 68\n8 - Zeke Elliot - Current rank: 19\n9 - Devonta Freeman - Current rank: 15\n10 - Jordy Nelson - Current rank: 32\n11 - Jordan Howard - Current rank: 45\n12 - DeMarco Murray - Current rank: 144\n13 - Dez Bryant - Current rank: 83\n14 - LeSean McCoy - Current rank: 53\nIf we re-drafted today, based on total points scored (QB’s not included since we didn’t select any 1st round). It would look like this:\n1- Gurley - Drafted 21st\n2 - Hunt - Drafted 25th\n3 - Diggs - Drafted 66th\n4 - Thompson - UNDRAFTED FA\n5 - Bell - Drafted 2nd\n6 - Fournette - Drafted 31st\n7 - Brown - Drafted 3rd\n8 - Freeman - Drafted 9th\n9 - Hopkins - Drafted 20th\n10 - Elliot - Drafted 8th\n11 - Hyde - Drafted 50th\n12 - Green - Drafted 5th\n13 - Thomas - Drafted 22nd\n14 - Nelson - Drafted 10th\n\nAlright Alight Alright… A day late but here we are. \nSome Waiver, Injury and Trade news:\nWattmeWhip wins the Buck Allen pickup this week at $27…not the first time he’s been bid on heavily this year, previously won on waivers by Two Gurleys at $21…Thats a lot of money spent this year on an up and down player. \nHoodie Cru, after their Weekly Win (166 points - highest this season) had to do some serious roster shuffling with OBJ going down for the year…Another top pick bites the dust..\nKnickerbockers gets a boost in the form of AP being traded to the Cardinals.  I think this ups his value quite a bit, and for all of us waiting for the Cardinals offense to click, maybe this gets the ball moving in the right direction. \nLast Week\n2 very close games had a large impact on the standings.  \nWattmeWhip narrowly edges out Nasty Sack 126 vs. 123.  This loss brings Nasty Sack to 2-3 despite being tied for most points scored this season.  WattmeWhip continues their improbable and low scoring run to 4-1.  With 6 teams ahead from a point perspective, and 2 only 5 points behind - each win matters, and a big scoring week will help solidify playoff positioning. \nHome bologna lost a close one to Cutlets, 115 to 113.  Both teams are now sitting at 3-2.  After Cutlets championship hangover the first 2 weeks, they have won 3 straight on the backs of players on bad teams.  Someone needs to catch, run, throw, and score for an NFL team, even if those teams are god awful (see: browns, colts, bears). \nThis weeks Preview:\n3 massive games this week that will go a long way in shaping the second half of the season. And 1 big game that may shape the Toilet Trophy race\n2nd place 2 Gurleys Vs 4th place Laces Out\n2 veteran teams - draft well, waiver well, make the tough calls and right plays.  Both are primed for playoffs. \n3rd place WattmeWhip vs. 6th place Home bologna\nHome Bologna looking to bounce back after their tough loss and WattmeWhip looking to keep the train rolling along after their close win. \n5th place Hoodie Cru vs. 7th place Drinking Forte\nHoodie cry coming in riding a two game win streak - how will the loss of OBJ affect him?  Well, it would affect any of us, but he made some serious moves this waiver so we’ll see.  Drinking Forte is living on the edge…the edge of the playoffs that is.  7th place in this league is simply 1st of the Losers.  A loss this week will likely cause a tumble down the standings thanks to their 4th lowest points scored total. \nLast but not least\n0-5 Odeezus Vs. 1-4 Knickerbockers. \nIs this the week ODeezus gets a win on the board? Doug Martin looked legit in his comeback and pairing him with CJ Anderson could be just what the doctor ordered.\n\nATTENTION:\nA Blockbuster trade just took place between The Sack Fumblers and 2 Gurleys 1 Kupp. \nAs commissioner, I approved the trade after a lengthy review. \nIf there are issues, take it to the Players Associate President and he'll file a formal complaint.\n\nGoing to keep this short and sweet because I'm DEEPLY invested in the Yankees and can't really concentrate on anything else. \nJust wanted to call out the devastating loss by Drinking Fortes.  With so few points scored overall, they need every win they can get.  This week....They missed out on a win to Hoodie Cru by .9 points!!\nYes.. .9 points... that's less than a yard..\nFantasy is Pain.  Pain is Fantasy\n\nWOW Week 7 is almost in the books.  That means we’re just over halfway through our regular season…\nIn a league as close as ours (10 teams .500 or better), every game counts.  Might be too early to worry about playoff positioning, but the outcomes of some games this week will have a ripple affect on the season. \n#2 WattmeWhip Vs. #5 Hoodie Cru\nCousin battle coming down to the wire.  With the winner likely sitting in second place. \nNo Fournette this week clearly hurt WattmeWhip, but they made up for it with some solid plays of Thompson in the Flex and Forte in the RB.  A pedestrian game from Gronk hurts his chances, a TD from him last night would have likely sealed the victory. \nHoodie Cru will be counting on HIS Thompson and Agholor tonight.  Down 20 points with two high risk, high reward guys isn’t exactly where you want to be, but I’m sure he’ll take it. Especially after watching his bench put up quite a few points (while his 2 Flex spots combined for 3.5). \n#3 Laces Out Vs. #12 Knickerbockers\nLow scoring game comes at bad time for Laces Out.  A low scoring loss here to the lowly Knickerbockers will not crush their hopes and dreams, it will just make things that much harder come playoff seeding time. \nThey still have their K going tonight, the magnificent Jake Elliot, so anything is possible.  \nFor the Knickerbockers, they have Crowder going tonight. Most times, you’d take the WR over the K any day of the week..this year, as many know…Crowder has played just about as poorly as a WR can, scoring less than 30 points over the course of the ENTIRE season. Him putting up even a few might give them the edge over Laces Out, but a few points from him this year is no guarantee. \nMORE TO COME TOMORROW AS THE STANDINGS SHAKE OUT\nCommish",

    "title": "ANOTHER TRADE",
    "content": "ANOTHER TRADE\nWattmeWhip sends Gronk! and the artist formerly known as Andy Dalton to 2 Gurleys for Austing Sefarian-Jenkins and MVP frontrunner Wentz.\n\nLet’s take a look at the standings!  Love how the Elderty boys are sitting 1-4!\nPlayoffs\nLaces Out \nPut together a fine week beating Hoodie Cru and finding themselves in pole position. Huge DEF performance from Bal (not the first time I’ve said that) gave them an early cushion coming out of Thursday night.  McCoy did what he does, Gordon impressed and Marvin Jones put up one of his best weeks.  158 points scored despite a .7 from Gabriel and 0 from Moncrief.  Playoffs are a near lock. \nDez and Confused\nTough loss to swallow to the lowly Knickerbockers.  But when you’re opponent puts up 191, theres not much to be done.  All that said, the biggest loss this week for Dez and Confused comes from the suspension of Zeke Elliot.  It was a good run Zeke…He’ll be back for the second week of the playoffs, so as long as the squad holds serve there is still a lot of hope in the air. \nWattmeWhip\nWatt cruised to victory against Aceboogie. New addition Wentz had a solid game.  AB wasn’t quite himself, but he’s not a player to worry about.  Solid performances from Butker (K) and Washington (RB) put them over the top. Built a nice cushion for themselves for the second half of the year. \nHoodie Cru\nLost a heart breaker to Laces Out.  Two underrated and undrafted RBs (McKinnon + Thompson) are leading this now potent team.  A 0 from Kerley hurt their chances this week, but this is a team to keep an eye on, especially if Oakland (Carr + Crabtree) pick things up).\n2 Gurley 1 Kupp\nHuge win to stop 2 Guleys slide down the standings.  Of course, this was led by Deshaun Watson who…WOW…this guy can play (and the Jets passed on him…sorry…couldn’t help myself). Solid team all around, and with the newly acquired Gronk..they are looking more and more dangerous. \nJetsetters\nTough loss…a better game from Hunt was needed…Julio didn’t do much...Reed went out…Beasley went out…yet they where in this thing thanks to PHI Def, their K, and last FLEX play.  If the stars play like stars, and the support does what it needs to, then this League Rookie might find themselves in the playoffs.  \nNo Playoffs…But close...\nHome Bologna\nJuuuuust missing out on a spot, but as the 2nd of 5 teams all tied at 4-4, they are still right in the mix. This was just one of those games that you lose over the course of the season..team played solid but without a breakout performance, it’s tough to win. \nSack Fumblers\nStill only 30 points behind the 6th and final spot of the playoffs, Sack Fumblers has made move after move to overcome some serious adversity. McCaffrey, Kamara, Ertz, Thielan…this is a good squad and the win this week looks like a turning point. \nDrinking Forte\nNeeded the win against Odeezus, have to take care of business when fighting for position. Gotta think Big Ben picks it up, Evans and Thomas can go off any moment, so can Kelce.  \nCutlet Bottom\nThe win snaps the 2 game slide, and though they don’t have the points, they’re sitting tied at 4-4 so every win matters.  Some nice pieces on the roster, still have 2 Browns though...\nNo Playoffs…Hope is dwindling\nKnickerbockers\nWell that was quite the win against the top team in the league… Wilson was ridiculous, Hopkins seems to have some serious chemistry with Watson, Doyle played the game of his life, Crowder remembered how to play football and the Cowboys Def performance put them over the top.  Long way to go for Knickerbockers to find the playoffs, but take solace in winning the Weekly scoring award!\nNastiest Sack\nThats 5 losses in a row.  the first 4 where by a combined 30 points..this week…they lost by 30 points.  3rd most points scored this year and a roster many owners envy hasn’t been enough.  We’re looking at a run the table or bust week on the horizon. \nAceboogie\nAnother poor week in a season filled with them.  Garcon and Hill did not perform well, Miller might be losing his leg and they didn’t play a K (despite one putting up 11 points on their bench). Let’s see how this Ajayi trade pans out - though having two backs both in Philly might be a matchup problem going forward. \nNo Playoffs…Theres always next year\nOdeezus\nNot much to say here. Couple wins might change playoff positioning though so a spoiler role is in play.\n\n3 trades in 3 weeks for 2 Gurleys 1 Kupp. This time with Commish Dez and Confused. \nJordy, Pryor and Lewis \nfor\ndoctson, watkins, jackson\n\nI have a feeling Week 9 of the 2017 Fantasy Season might live in infamy.  With losses across the top of the standings, we have 10 teams within legit striking distance of the playoffs.  \nWith 4 weeks to go, things are getting really tight!\nWill do a matchup preview later this week.\n\nBeen a long time away, rehashing previous decisions and imagining an alternate universe where I don’t fall from 6-1 to 7-5, one where Zeke eats is suspension at the beginning of the year and not during crunch time..\nWith that out of the way, the league stops for no man, team or commish.  This has been the tightest season yet with 8 teams fighting for their playoff positioning and lives.  Those 8 don’t even include arguably the best roster in the league (belonging to Nastiest Sack). \nLet’s get together this weekend for Beers and Wings - Invite to follow - but plan for 1pm at Mel’s Burger Bar on the Upper East side - All you can eat wings, sliders and beers for $25!\nLet’s start at the top and work our way through some of the big matchups this week. \nWatt me Whip\nSitting in pole position with a locked in playoff spot is WattmeWhip.  They are riding a 3 game win streak and finally putting up the points their projections have been..well…projecting all season.  The trade for Wentz has proven a success, Antonio Brown is capable of putting up 40 every week,  pick ups of Rudolph and Drake are looking better and better, and if Fournette finds his way out of the doghouse then this team will be tough to beat.  Worth noting that a loss this week to Drinking Fortes, and some wins elsewhere can knock them from having a Bye Week in the playoffs. \n2 Gurleys 1 Kupp\n2nd place after a ridiculous 5 game win streak has Gurleys locked into the playoffs and in position for a bye.  They have the 8th highest point total this season, but when the schedule/matchups fall your way there is nothing to do but sit back and laugh.  It’s crazy that they have 0, ZERO, NONE, players that they drafted.  Playing Dez and Confused this weekend and we’ll be digging into that in detail later…\nSack Fumblers\nProbably my favorite team and story of the season.  Written off within a week after David Johnson went down, but thats when the fun began.  Pick up after pick up (63 of them total!), trade after trade, slowly but surely.  Not everything was a homer, but when you put together a team that LEADS THE LEAGUE IN SCORING, after losing David Johnson, you deserve serious props.  Riding a 5 game win steak, if one or both of the teams ahead of him lose this week than they will finish the season as the 1 seed.  Oh, and he’s won the last 2 weekly scoring titles, in addition to one earlier this year…so yea…he made his money back and is now playing “for the love of the game”\nLaces Out\nWhat a difference a week makes!  After losing to WattmeWhip last week, Laces Out tumbled from 1st to 4th in the league.  Thanks to their point total, they are locked into a spot, but seeding is still up in the air.  They are matched up against top seed Sack Fumblers in a potential championship preview.  Winner of this game could find themselves in position for a bye, loser is playing next week.  Not exactly a playoff game atmosphere thanks to the lower stakes, but will be a matchup to keep your eye one if you’re positioning yourselves for a playoff run. \nDez and Confused\nSomehow, despite going 1-4 the last month+ of the season Dez is still in control of their fate.  Another tough loss last week, no longer has the same visceral effect as previous losses have had, but the numbing has to stop at one point.  A win this week against 2nd place 2 Gurleys locks up a playoff spot.  A loss this week and a loss by Hoodie Cru in their matchup locks up a playoff spot.  A loss this week and a win by Hoodie Cru…god I can’t say it.  Don’t think it - positive thoughts only. So lets think positively... a high scoring win (170 points, etc.) and some losses from teams ahead in the standings could mean Dez finishes in 3rd!!  What a time to be alive!!!!  Silver lining…looks like Rodgers will be back week 15, to pair with Jordy who doesn’t know how to play football without him…thats the semi-final…and then we ALLLLLLL know whose coming back week 16 - thats right, Zeke “Keep feeding him” “keep appealing” “i didn’t hit her, but maybe he did” Elliot, will be back for the CHAMPIONSHIP.  Every week from here on out is do or die, and the squad WILL get stronger…just have to give them a shot..\nJetSetters + Home Bologna\nNew comer to the league making his presence known VS. \"perennial league punching bag who turned his shit around when he moved to Arizona and became a sports fan” Balogna. \nThis is a playoff game.  Winner is in unless Hoodie Cru goes off and scores a ton of points in a win.  But more importantly, the Loser of this game is out.  \nTwo old school Boston Buds, battling from across the country - This is what fantasy football is about.  More than winning, more than losing, definitely more than rooting for a 3rd string receiver on the Jaguars to have a fluke 40+ yard TD - its about competing with friends while sitting on a couch 2000+ miles apart from each other. \nHoodie Cru\nT\nwo huge wins in a row has Hoodie Cruller primed for the role of spoiler.  After squeaking out the win last week on the back of their kicker, they have the potential to both knock people out of the playoffs, and knock themselves into the playoffs with a win this week.  Losing Crabtree to suspension is a heartbreaker and you gotta figure he’s not the only fantasy team in the world cursing him for wearing a gaudy and awesome gold chain on the field in the first place. \nDrinking Forte, Nastiest Sack, Cutlets Bottom, Knickerbockers\nSolid season, close wins, closer losses, good picks/pickups, very bad picks/pickups.  \nWe salute you, you’ve kept competition up the last few weeks while the lights were growing dimmer and dimmer.  This is why this league is great - consistent effort and competition.  Well done, let’s run it back next year.  But before we run it back - some of you have a chance to play spoiler this week - so set your lineups, make the right plays, and end the season on a high note!!\nThe Fluids\nAce Boogie, Odezus…two perennial playoff teams mired in the muck.  2-10 vs. 1-11.  Toilet is on the line, but not really - an Odeezus win ties them at the bottom of the standings, but unless Odeezus somehow scores 100 points MORE THAN Aceboogie, he’ll still get the infamous trophy (PJ I haven’t forgotten about you, its in the mail, merry christmas). \nGreat regular season - lets keep it up these last few weeks!\nCommish",

Well done knocking out JetSetters this week - keep it going and pull the upset in Round 1!\nDez and Confused took care of business and secured themselves a playoff spot after beating 2 Gurley 1 Kupp who had a down week and will be dropping from 2nd to 3d in the standings…Now instead of the bye, they get matched up with the suddenly hot Home Balonga. \nSack Fumblers beat down Laces Out this week and will be jumping into the 2nd place spot in our final standings.  They will have a bye this week while Laces Out faces off against Dez and Confused. \nDespite Hoodie Cru’s win and climb up the standings they will not be participating in the playoffs this year.  \nWe have 2 playoff games this week, and since this is 3 years into the league we have some historic data to dig into!\nLaces Out vs. Dez and Confused. \nThis is becoming a storied rivalry in the league, with Dez up 2 games to 1. \n2015 - Dez 118 - Laces 98\n2016 - Dez 130 - Laces 153\n2017 - Dez 165 - Laces 132\n2017 Playoffs - ????????\nNot liking the every other game trend, but only 3 points separate these team this year from a Total point standpoint, so its going to be close.  \n2 Gurley 1 Kupp vs. Home Balogna\n2 Gurleys is up 2 games to 1 on Balogna in their careers against each other.  \n2015 - 2 Gurley 110 - Balogna 94\n2016 - 2 Gurley 166 - Balogna 78\n2017 - 2 Gurley 91 - Balogna 106\n2017 Playoffs - ??????????\nOf course, the most recent game, and really the only relevant game went to Home bologna in a nail biter.

    "title": "Week 1 Recap",
    "content": "We had a damn successful draft, saw plenty of trade offers (though none accepted), everyone seems to be looking for RB’s and now Week 1 is in the books. \nLets take a look at the games from last week, and dig into what each team should be excited/worried about going forward. \n2 Gurley 1 Kupp smokes Game of Jones 187 to 127\nThis game felt a lot closer coming out of the 1pm games.  Dare I say Game of Jones was even confident?  Getting 34 points from James Conner, who’s pinch hitting for Bell, who was on the opposing team (2 Gurley)…how could this not work out?!?!\nWell, Tyrek Hill is how..He put up an all-time game, dropping 48 points on Game of Jones. \n2 Gurleys is scary as is…and if Bell ever comes back, we could be looking at a juggernaut.  Congrats on the WEEK 1 POINTS WIN\nAs for Game of Jones…his all WR draft strategy seems to have been fucked…of his 4 WR’s, who started, they scored a combine 16 points…thats not gonna do it.  With Baldwin doubtful and Cooper still in a funk, Game of Jones runs the risk of falling behind the standings early in the season \nCutlets Bottom rolls TheACEboog1e 172 to 125\nCutlets bottom put together some great performances, Jones, Mixon, Cook, and Lewis all put 20+ which was more than enough to get past ACE’s trio of Cam, Cobb and McCaffrey. \nThis matchup would have been much closer had Olsen not gone down with an injury early, and if the Chargers DEF came to play. \nThe Sack Fumblers starting strong against Drinking Fortes, winning 151 to 122. \nAfter “winning” the shit luck award last year, The Sack Fumbler ran it back with Johnson and Luck.  Lucky for him, Luck looked good, Johnson seem ready for a big workload and new addition, Gronk, Gronked about against Houston. \nFor Drinking Fortes, the “Mahomes” experiment/experience would have gone much better had he started him..He has to be feeling good about his WR combo of Evans and Hopkins, despite the loss this week, there is potential on this team to shock the world. \nHome Balogna, puts the Nastiest Sack in a body bag, winning easily 156 to 103. \nNastiest sack is a real case of have and have nots…3 players scored 20+ setting the stage for a big week, but the remains 7 starters put up less than 10 each.  you can survive a few bad weeks here and there..but you can’t survive all your players having bad weeks in the same week..\nJust a solid W for Balogna, who only started 1 TE in week 1!.  Good, but not great games from his starters brought home the win and with Cousins, Adams, Thielan and Gordon…my gut is telling me there will be more wins than losses this year for Balogna. \nAaron Rodgers saves the Packers and Hoodie Cru, who comes out on top of ODeezus 157 to 127. \nRodgers went down early, and it looked like that might have been the window ODeezus needed to squeak out the early season win. Even without Rodgers, that trade for Michael Thomas (which made us all shake our head and say “ohhh Billy”) is actually looking damn good after his 38 point performance. \nODeezus will be fine, Wilson, OBJ and Cook will make one of the top “Triplets” in the league. He goes as they go. \nTrump 2020 wins his league debut against, none other than our 2K17 champion, Laces out.  \nTrump 2020 rode Crowell and this DYNAMIC Jets offense to the promise land Monday night.  Can he do it again?  Will the Jets score 48 more points this season?!?!  What the hell happened to Hunt?  Lots of questions, but lots of potential.  \nEach game counts and this was a tough one to watch go by the wayside.  Laces didn’t get much from RB2, TE, and both FLEX, but saw Gurley and Brady do what they do.  Once Diggs and Jones Jr. pick it up, this will be a tough team to beat. \nKnickerbockers slam dunk WattmeWhip 168 to 114. \nKnickerbockers looking good with an well rounded team.  Going down the line of their starters, there isn’t a wink link.  Ajayi?  No looks like he’s the guy in philly….Gordon?  No…he’s a freak of nature who I’d love to smoke a bong with. \nWattmeWhip needs to thank Samara for a monster week.  He made this matchup look far closer than it really was.  with 4 players scoring under 5 points (and a 5th with only 6 points)…WattmeWhip has to be starting to wonder how they will score!\nCommish out",

    "content": "Week 2 is wrapped up!  Lets get to last weeks recap\nBut before we get into that...  \nQuick shout out to our Fantasy Baseball league…Jesus Christ this is a long season and we’re finally in the semi-championship round. \nBleacher Creatures (Matt) vs. Judge and Andujar (Mike B) are squaring off once again.  Bleacher Creatures owns a 2-1 record against Judge and Andujar this year, and their win in the last week of the season was for “home field” and the Bye earlier in the playoffs.  \nBoth teams have been top of the charts this season and sport a healthy collection of yankees. \nThe other match up is between Up Your Butt Jobu (PJ M) whose team has been utterly dominant this season and Pauls Team (PJ O) who has arguably the most basic name in all of fantasy sports.  \nUp Your Butt has over 50 more wins on the season than Pauls Team, but that will all be for naught if the upset gods start playing tricks after 7 months of fantasy baseball. \nNOW FOR FOOTBALL\nKnickerbockers vs. Laces Out\nLaces out knocked out Knickerbockers this week, bringing both teams to 1-1. \nHuge games from Gurley and Diggs paced the squad, outshining AJ Green's monster performance from Thursday night. \nKnickerbockers could have played Dede Westbrook making this a closer game, but the real stories are whether or not Fournette will be back this week.\nOh and it looks like he might have just won’t he lottery with Gordon going to the Pats…he’s no Moss…but he’s still a freak of nature who, if he buys in and sticks to the straight and narrow would be Bradys favorite new play thing. \nTrump 2020 vs ODeezus\nThis one was ugly…Trump 106, ODeezus 102\nCouple miss-starts could have cost the game for ODeezus, but with Trump trading for Breida…and not playing him..and then him going off…he’s lucky he got the win.  \nWith only 245 \"Points For”, Trump has the lowest point total of all 2-0 teams..wins are wins as we find out every season. \nHoodie Cru vs. Nasty Sack\nHoodie continues their scorching start thanks to the continued success of their draft day trade for Michael Thomas. \nNastiest remains one of the more cursed players in the history of our league - maybe he should stick to baseball. \nBologna vs. Sack Fumblers\nBologna takes home the high score award for the week - Congrats!\nThis is the best start to a season Bologna has ever had - this past week he had 3 players all put up 30+\nSack fumblers barely scratched the 100 point mark this week after shit performances from Johnson and Gronk, as well as the wasted day from Cole who was stuck on the bench. \nDrinking Fortes vs AceBoogie\nDrink Forte falls to 0-2 despite putting up 146 points.  He had a huge day from Mahomes who looks like this years Watson, aswell as the standard and excellent performances from Evans and Hopkins.  They sat a whole bunch of points this week, so the outcome was semi-self inflicted. \nAce Boogie riding high with the win on the backs of his home town heroes Newton and McCaffrey.  Solid games from Ertz, Watkins and Coleman rounded out this well earned win. \n2 Gurleys vs WattmeWhip\n2 Gurleys took home another huge win despite the absence of Bell…with the most points scored in the league through the first 2 weeks, we all need to pray Bell remains the most selfish player in football. \nWattmeWhip had a bit of bounce back week despite the loss after a flurry of moves on the weekend.  Dez Bryant is now rostered in our league, but not THE league!  I still got love for him, can’t deny it. \nGood news is that Wentz will be back this week, and while Jeffery won’t be, its only a matter of time and thats a really solid QB/WR pairing.  \nGame of Jones vs. Cutlets Bottom\nLast but not least, Game of Jones gets himself in the win column thanks to HIS pairing of Watson/Fuller, as well as solid weeks from Zeke, Conner (please please never come back Bell!!!) and Cooper.  Things are looking up for the commish\nCutlets had a massive week from Big Ben as well as solid performances from Cooks and Chicago DEF.  He needed more from Julio, but shouldn't be worried there.  The worry should come from his duel Tenn RB threat of Henry/Lewis only putting up a combined 11 points…1 offense, 2 guys, same position, running QB, only so many touches….might need to rethink the strategy\nNext weeks write up will look at the early season standings - its usually around week 3 where teams get both confident and desperate....We'll see... \nCommish Out\n\nThe Undefeated:\nHome Balogna -  Another week another top score win.  Not many weak spots on the squad and now it could be Baker time\nTrump 2020 - Newbie yet to have a loss despite being 8th in \"Points For\"\nBattling for Playoff position:\nHoodie Cru - Ridley on the bench in his breakout week cause the loss, but picking him up could put them over the top\n2 Gurleys - tough week while away in Italy.  back at it, reports of Bell to the Jets would be a dream like scenario\nGame of Jones - Team is rounding into form behind Watson/Fuller.  Needs Baldwin back. \nCutlets Bottom - Jimmy G down and out but Big Ben is looking good.  Dicey RB situation but solid Jones/Cooks receiving duo\nSack Fumblers - Team is coming together nicely, leaves some points on the bench, but its better to have hard game-time decisions, then a roster full of guys all scoring less than 10 points\nLooking up at .500:\nAce Boogie - solid behind his pairing of newton/mccaffrey and waiting on the draft day trade (which netted him Ingram) to pan out. \nKnickerbockers - lost and is most deserving…played 2 guys who were clearly out.  Don’t like seeing this! I give you this one mulligan, but your on thin ice. \nWatt me Whip - huge win to get out of the “totally defeated“ cellar.  Injuries have really hurt them, but once the full team is at health, there is some big play/point potential up and down the roster. \nLaces Out - Lowest scoring week, and first below 100 points in this early season.  Still a solid and dangerous team, just needs more from the role players. \nPrevious Toilet Winners:\nODeezus (1-2) - 1 of our 3 previous toilet winners, squeaked by with a win thanks in large part to the lack of effort by his opponent. Team is in shambles, don’t let the win fool you, this could get ugly before it gets better.\nDrinking Fortes/Nastiest Sack - The other two of our previous toilet winners, brothers by birth and through fantasy torment, starting 0-3 isn’t a death sentence, but its damn close.\n\nWhat a week!!  \nThis weeks write up is brought to you by non other than toilet bowl winner and bottom dweller - ODeezus (Michael O'Donnell)\nCongrats to Cutlets Bottom for the first 200+ point performance and the weekly scoring award!\nWithout further ado...\n----------------------------------------\nHello All - \nGreetings from the bottom. \nIt is a place I have grown accustomed to the past two years. It’s a place where moves are made in silence, often for naught. It is a place where Tarik Cohen rests peacefully on your bench while scoring 31 points (Mazel Tov, Tarik).  \nIt’s a place I now call home. \nAs Team ODEEZUS plows forward, encumbered by what I can only assume is a curse, bad voodoo, or someone opening an umbrella indoors, I have found a certain comfort in the bottom and the perspective it offers. Thus, from this unique vantage point, I offer my take on the Week 4 match-ups. \nODEEZUS vs. LACES OUT\nAs I touched on above, Team ODEEZUS is mired in what my brother and I now creatively refer to as, “The ODEEZUS Curse”.\nHot new waiver wire pickup? Oh, he’ll get injured in the first quarter like OJ Howard. Which is almost as bad as my last ‘hot new waiver wire pickup’, Philip Lindsay, getting ejected for embarrassing himself by trying to land a punch. But i shouldn’t fret on weeks past.\nLACES OUT jumped to an early lead this week, with big performances on Thursday night from both Gurley and Diggs. On cue, Dalvin Cooked provided a whopping 2 points for Team ODEEZUS on Thursday, setting him up for almost certain failure.  \nMuch like the Cowboys, Team ODEEZUS is not meant to play from behind, and after more pedestrian efforts from big ticket stars like OBJ  and Russell Wilson, hope is finally, and truly, lost. Tarik Cohen had 31 points on the bench, and it wouldn’t of meant a damn thing if I started him…\nThis, my friends, is the bottom…\nGAME OF JONES vs. HOME BALOGNA PT DEUX\nThe difference between this match up and our previous entry is like much like going from watching a Hawks-Hornets game to checking in on Warriors-Rockets.\nGAME OF JONES, riding high on Zeke’s career performance, put up an impressive 179.15 points. While James Connor has come back down to earth, if Zeke hits his stride, GAME OF JONES is going to be in good shape. Getting a 16 spot from Justin Tucker ain’t bad either.\nHOME BOLOGNA PT DEUX also had no problem putting up points, running into the wrong opponent at the wrong time. And let me say this…while HOME BOLOGNA PT. 2 came into this week undefeated, I sense trouble in paradise…calling it!\n2 GURLEY’S 1 KUPP vs. DRINKING FORTE’S\nThis one was ugly from the start. This was Pat-Dolphins all over again. Tim was winning by 90 points before Mahomes played. ‘Nuff said.\nCUTLET’S BOTTOM vs. WATTmeWhipWATTmeJJ\nA barn burner!\nIn the highest scoring matchup of the week, CUTLET’S BOTTOM pulled out a big win on the back of…well just about all of his players. \nWATTmeWhipWATTmeJJ had an outlandish performance from Kamara but rather underwhelming efforts from the likes of LeSean Mccoy and former Team ODEEZUS standout, Austin Sefarian-Jenkins. \nTip: if Team ODEEZUS is dropping guys from his dilapidated and historically bad team, it might not be a good idea to pick them up…\nHOODIE CRU vs THEACEBOOG1E\nAhh who remembers that draft day trade? Ol’ Nick D, sitting on top of the world, flush with mid-round picks, and ready to nab Randall Cobb AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.\nFour weeks in, and it would appear that Billy may have known what he was doing. He comfortably walked away with this win, even with the star of the draft-day trade, Michael Thomas, only being targeted 4 times, down from his usual 36.\nThis was going to be a tough one for theACEboog1e to win from the get go, with the Panthers (and Nick’s two best players) on their bye.\nTrump 2020 vs. The Sack Fumblers\nWell, things look like they finally caught up to Trump 2020. Aside from Matty Ice’s 29 points, Trump 2020 struggled to find a big scorer elsewhere. As the owner of the other member of the Jets backfield committee, I feel your pain brother.\nAnother solid day for tall-ass Ben, riding Cooper Kupp and the vaunted GB defense to victory. With David Johnson showing signs of life, it appears The Sack Fumblers are in it for the long haul.\nThe Nastiest Sack vs. KnickerBockers\nThis is the last matchup, and I have to actually do some work, so don’t have much. It was a blow out. Nastiest Sack gets off the schneid with some big performances from Golden Tate and James White. Wouldn’t anticipate that continuing, but then again, I’m in last!\nAfter Hugo’s embarrassing defeat at the hands of Team ODEEZUS last week (in which he started two inactive players while leaving 20 points scorer Adrian Peterson on the bench), his team largely laid an egg, with Brees, Gordon and Fournette combining for under 20 points.\nIn the words of Joe Girardi: it’s not what you want.\nThat’s all for me, folks. I’m hoping that actually writing one of these damn things will a) get Matt to stop bothering me and b) create some positive juju for Team ODEEZUS moving forward. \nBecause when faced with rock bottom, there is only one place to go…\n\nHere we go! Another week in the books. This will be brought to you by another bottom feeder no other then Pj O'Brien. Alright fellas well start from the closest game of the week between two top perennials \nGame of Jones Vs. Hoodie Crew \nGame of Jones started out really strong with an amazing performance by James Conner, brought his projections up to about 160 and it looked like that was all she wrote for Billy the Kiddd. But some poor performances by Cooper, Baldwin and Fuller smashed that dream of a victory and by Monday night all Hoodie Crew needed was 1.5 points from his mind blowing game day trade to win. Which of course happened. The commish might want to reconsider his “depth” at wide receiver post.\nOur next matchup well start off with two bottom feeders looking to claw their way back up the ladder. \nWaTTmEWHippWattmeJJ vs. ODEZZUS\nWattmewhip made some big moves in free agency this past week dropping a whopping 75$ out of his 100$. 3/4 players picked up dropped 15+ but ODEZZUS had a hell of a week and really strong performances from ODB, T. Lockett, D. Thomas, CLE DEF., and his kicker dropping a whopping 16 points was to much for Wattmewhip to overcome. \nOur next matchup between:\nThe Sack Fumblers vs Knickerbockers \nThis was a pretty tight matchup through and through. Both teams players put up solid numbers through out the matchup. For Sack Fumblers he finally got Edleman back who put up nice numbers for his first game, also DJ and Joe Mixon both had 20 point performances, unfortunately for Knickerbockers who also had nice solid numbers through out and didnt leave the RB position open this week... although it seems the reason for the heartbreaking loss goes to losing J. Ajayi in the first quarter of the game. \nOur next tight barn burner was between: \nThe ACEBoogie and our newest addition to the fantasy family (who we might want to get rid of after the season if he continues to shine) \n￼\n TRUMP 2020\nVery close match here. In the beginning it looked like Trump 2020 was a sure win with his projections raising up to the 175 point area with some really strong performances from I. Crowell and an amazing performance from Ebron in the Thursday night game. But ACEBoogie had just as strong performances from Ertz.. McCaffrey looked a little shaky in the beginning of the game but came out strong and finished with 20 points and looked like his draft day pickup of the suspended Ingram worked out to be a good wait with a nice 18 point performance and 2 touchdowns his first game back. Unfortunately just wasn't enough to beat TRUMP 2020\nNext up we got Laces Out Vs. the Nastiest Sack\nBoth teams for the most part had very poor performances from their players. The Nastiest Sack had A. Brown and J. White with season highs (Brown with 29.3 and J. White with 23.7). Even with 2 of Laces Outs players scoring 0 points he was able to sneak by with a victory with strong performances from T. Gurly and his go to QB...T. Brady slid him through to the W. To make him 3-2 on the season. \nOur number one seed Home Balogna vs. 2 Gurlys 1 Kupp turned out to be a land slide. As usual Jimmer continues to put up high volume numbers week in and week out. With strong performances from Theilen, D. Adams, Gordon and PITT Def. With a 24 point performance 2 Gurlys 1 Kupp never really stood a chance even though he had a couple of stand out performances from BAL. Def and P. Rivers... Just wasnt enough to get past our league leader in points. \nAnd our final matchup, another not so close game goes to Drinking Fortes vs. Cutlets bottoms. \nAlthough Cutlets Bottoms had a nice performance from Big Ben this week and Carolina DEF.  The rest of the team did not come to play this week and Brandon Cooks with the big goose egg 0 did not help either. Drinking Fortes had a strong performance this week putting up 137 points beating his projected total with some strong performances from Hopkins, 19 points from S. Michel and the rook who continues to shock everyone Patrick Mahomes continues to dominate and the rest of the team all putting up solid numbers led him to an easy 40 point victory.\n\ngood to be back!\nAfter 2 weeks of fantastic “guest commentators” and last week off (I was in Ireland drinking far to much and sleeping far too little) lets dig into how things look at the midway point of the season. \nFirst and foremost - Congrats to Laces Out for their Week 6 High Point Score win - putting up a massive 173 point week in one of the highest scoring games of the season!\nThis week, we’re congratulating ODeezus who put up 166 - bringing his record to 2-1 since he wrote a write-up which is looking like the ODeezus curse breaker he was hoping for. \nOur top two teams are both riding 3 game winning streaks and sporting impressive 6-1 records.  They are no fluke, rolling out 2 of the 3 highest scoring teams in the league. \nHome Balogona squeaked out a win on the incredibly consistent back of Adam Thailand - despite getting goose eggs from their two starting backs.  Gordon should be back healthy after their bye week - but Hyde looks to have lost some value being traded from the run happy/succesful BROWNS…to the “in utter shambles” Jaguars.  If fournette comes back healthy, Hyde falls from clear every down starter to back up…\nTrump 2020 keeps stringing along wins thanks to the stellar play of Kareem Hunt…whom he was trying to trade earlier this year…good thing he only received trash offers\nHoodie Cru is 3rd in record, but 2nd in scoring.  He has arguably the most dominant foursome in the league consisting of Rodgers, Juju, Thomas and Saquan.  This is a team built for the playoffs.  Poor weeks from other starters don’t hurt as much when averaging 80 among 4 players. \nRounding out the top 6 (i.e.: Playoff Teams) are The Sack Fumblers, Cutlets Bottom, and Laces Out.  All three consist of consistent veterans and big play young-ins. If they all hit at the same time, a run to the ship is very much in the cards for all three of these teams. \nThe bottom are fighting for some semblance of consistency, either for their playoffs hopes or pride. \nNext week we’ll dig into how the draft and picks are looking through 8 weeks. \nCommish",

    "content": "GENTLEMAN\nApologies for the radio silence the last few weeks.  Turns out when you pay more attention to work than to fantasy write ups you get promoted and get to travel around the UK.  \nDon’t get me wrong, a fantasy championship, in the league I commission is the only thing I have my mind on - i've just focused my efforts on my team rather than building y'all up through my captivating prose. \nWith that!\nWe’re now in the final stretch of the regular season.  3 more weeks to go, and we have our first playoff team secured. Congrats to ODEEZUS for bringing him his second high score award this year.  The comeback might be coming a bit too late though. \nLets hear it for the leagues newest member - TRUMP 2020, who despite having the 5th most points, has by far the best record, sitting pretty at 9-1.  Of course, regular season wins only mean something when you bring home the title, but there is a combination of luck, skill, timing, and history on his side as he is playoff bound. \nTrump 2020 beat #2 Home Balogna whose cinderella season is no fluke.  The loss dropped him to 3rd overall despite being #1 in points scored. \nThis week, Trump 2020 takes on the NEW #2 team in the standings - Hoodie Cru - who squeaked out a win on the back of Barkleys garbage time touches. While he might have cried a little when his trade for Hill was downright rejected, he still has a great team built on two huge draft day moves - “over drafting” JuJu and the now infamous and legendary trade for Michael Thomas. \n4th in the league is yours truly - Game of Jones - who has the 2nd most points this season.  Picking up James Connor before week 1 will go down as one of the all time great pre season pickups - granted, luck, greed, and selfishness on the part of Bell made this possible - but its guys like Connor that makes teams NOT pay guys like Bell.  Of course, Zeke as your 2nd best back is quite a luxury to have, and with Cooper looking to have woken up as a Cowboy - could this be the year the Commish finally breaks through?\nCutlets bottom pulled off a huge win over Laces out, vaulting them into 5th place, and in control of their own playoff destiny.  Cooks, Big Ben and Julio make up a consistently scary top 3.  His duel titan RB plan seems to be paying off more than originally thought by this commish. \nThe final playoff spot as of today belongs to THE ACEBOOG1E who is riding a 5 game win streak after starting the season 1-4. He has one of the top 4-somes with Cam, McCaffrey, Ingram and Ertz - they all can go off any given week.  This team is heating up at the right time and is looking scary. \nFunny thing this fantasy sports…The reasons I love it are the exact reasons I hate it. \n- Top RB this season (Gurley) belongs to 8th place Laces Out.  \n- 2 of top 3 QBs, including Mahomes who has been a revelation belong to 9th place Drinking Fortes. \n- The 2nd best running back (Kamara) belongs to 12th place WattmeWHIP\n- the 6th best WR and first drafted (Brown) plays his sundays for Nastiest Sack - 13th place\n- and lastly, the top WR this season Tyreek Hill is on by far the worst team in the league - Le’veons Career - granted this team also as Bell, who skipped the season….\nJust goes to show, its not who has the best players.  But who has the best team!\nLet this be a warning - trades involving non-playoffs teams to playoffs teams will be highly vetted and unlikely to be approved unless there are legitimate cases to be made.  \nHave pride in your team and how you manage it.  For those out of the race…time to play spoiler for those jockeying for position.  \nAll the best\nCommissioner O'Donnell",

    "content": "Week 12 – 2018\nYo, its my turn at a write up!\nOnly one week left to try and get a playoff seed OR one week left of begrudgingly setting a lineup for a league you have zero chance in now! (Better luck in year 5!).\nMatchup Reviews:\nGame of Jones (186.32) v theACEboog1e (171.89) \nAn important game for both parties, one would fall out of the playoff seeding and one would remain. Both teams put up a valiant effort with the two highest scores of the week. Game of Jones is now the point leader and is sitting as the 3rd seed, however a loss next week could still knock them out. theACEboog1e is third in points, so will be looking for a win this coming week to slot himself back up into the playoffs. With big point scorers on both teams (Cooper and CMC) they both probably thought they were in good standing. That being said it won’t be surprising if both make it into the playoffs.\nCutlet’s Bottom (140.88) v The Nastiest Sack (66.60)\nThis ended as a lopsided affair with Cutlet getting the win to keep him in the top six. The Nastiest Sack scored the mark of the beast (66.6), the lowest score of the season, with only one player getting double digit points. Week 13 is still important for The Nastiest Sack as they will be fighting to avoid that toilet bowl! Cutlet will also have a crucial game next week which may decide his fate for the playoffs. This may be a team on the rise with Josh Adams now seeming like a valuable asset, the only one who stunk on his team was Royce Freeman – it’s a shame I had high hopes for Freeman this year, only to be dashed by an undrafted rookie who came outta nowhere (Philip Lindsey).\nDrinking Forte’s (158.66) v ODEEZUS (173.66)\nBoth teams put up good point totals this week on the backs of multiple solid players. Whoever won here still had a chance to make it to the final 6, and it was our leader of the FF players association, ODEEZUS who got the W. With a strong all round team, might he be the fairytale story we haven’t seen since year 1? The resurgence of ODEEZUS might be enough to pull an upset and steal a playoff spot next week if he is lucky. Better luck next year Drinking Forte’s (although if you win next week, you can probably still force the toilet bowl upon your brother, so something worth paying for!).\nThe Sack Fumblers (128.98) v Le’Veons Career (120.96) \nI had the worst first round pick last year and my opponent had the worst first round pick this year (I feel your pain). I figured I had this matchup in the bag quite early on, then my points started to slow down later in the afternoon. I can’t say I wasn’t nervous when Miller pulled of a 97 yard TD on Monday night, for 17.7 points on 1 play! Even with Keke going out early my lead was just a little bit too much to be caught. Better luck next year, you probably won’t have the worst first round pick two years in a row…..\nHome Balogna pt duex (142.40) v Laces Out (82.62) \nSo it’s the reigning champs vs one of the power house teams. Home Balogna took care of business easily with a 60 point difference and officially clinched their spot in the playoffs (although it seemed unlikely they wouldn’t make it anyway). Home Balogna obviously had a great draft and seems intent on rubbing it in our faces by NOT HAVING SPENT EVEN $1 of FAAB! Not many moves are needed when you draft Gordon, Thielen and Adams I guess. Hard luck for last year’s winner, with early season injuries and not much luck in terms of replacements for them, there will be no back to back winner this time.\nHOODIE CRÜ !!! (146.42) v KnickerBockers (149.54)\nThe success of the much talked about draft day trade may be starting to finally dwindle, with Fournette back Hoodie Cru didn’t have much production out of Yeldon (although next week might be a saving grace for him, since Fournette forgot he is in the NFL and not the UFC, potentially giving Yeldon another week of production). Knickerbockers will be a middle of the pack finisher, no glory but no toilet either. Hoodie Cru has to keep it together one more week or risk missing out on his playoff spot.\nTrump 2020 (139.08) v WATTmeWhipWATTmeJJ (109.99)\nThe new hotness of our league, standing at a mighty 10-1 record was not to be defeated by the back end WATTmeWhipWATTmeJJ. A solid performance all round for the POTUS (or GEOTUS?) Trump 2020, Trump said we would get tired of winning and I am definitely tired of him winning. Maybe some better picks on DEF and K would’ve pushed his score a little higher. WATTmeWhipWATTmeJJ had some disappointment from Jeffery and Landry again and will be looking towards next year’s draft.\nLocked Playoff Spots:\nTrump 2020 is locked as the number 1 seed and will enjoy a bye in week 14 regardless of what goes on next week.\nHome Balogna pt duex has a spot locked up but it is not clear if they will maintain 2nd and get the bye week.\nTeams clenching their buttholes to try and get a spot with a win in week 13:\nGame of Jones probably is the least clenched of this group with a massive points lead and will most likely be in the playoffs, maybe even with the 2 seed depending how things play out.\nCutlet’s Bottom, The Sack Fumblers and HOODIE CRU!!! are all within 4 points of each other and will be pushing for the win in week 13. Even more dramatic it will be Cutlet’s Bottom v The Sack Fumblers next week, meaning the loser will most likely drop out the top 6.\ntheACEboog1e and ODEEZUS both sit at 6-6 and are looking to pull the upset and steal a playoff spot next week\nTeams competing for the glory of the toilet bowl and the pink t-shirt:\nLe’Veons Career and The Nastiest Sack are both contending for the prize sitting at 3-9, Le’Veons Career has a good point lead and may have an easier time avoiding the shame.\n\nWow! What a season.  Filled with triumph, heartbreak, bouts of confusion and brief moments of ecstasy. \nSome highlights and lowlights below, 1st round playoff matchups to be written tomorrow!\nHOODIE CRU\nThe biggest “loser” and arguably winner of next years “Shit Luck” award has to be Billy Obrien and his squad Hoodie Cru…Yes a 3 game losing streak to end the regular season is a bitter pill to swallow, knocking him from 3rd place and 2nd in scoring…to out of the playoffs…\nBut the real NUT PUNCH for him is the fact that he beat ODeezus, Aceboogie, Game of Jones, and Home Balogna…oh and lost by .25…yes a quarter of a point..to Cutlets bottom.   AND he only lost to Trump 2020 by 5 points!…\nThat means that of the 6 playoff teams…he’s 4-2, with the his 2 losses coming be less that 6 points…\nThats SHIT LUCK!\nNASTIEST SACK\nWell well well..the FIRST ever repeat winner…and no…he didn’t win a championship before or this year…he is the repeat TOILET BOWL WINNER. \nLe’veons Career made a real run for it, but with 50 more points and the W against Nasiests there was no other choice but than our most consistent Loser.  \nDespite the great pick of James White, and the consistently great Antonio Brown…the rest of the team left much to be desired…never really able to bounce back from Freeman hitting the IR early on. \nTrump 2020\nWith the top seed, 12-1 record and the bye week…that is a hell of a way to start their career in the league. \nYes, had the FEWEST Points against, meaning he might be the luckiest winner in the league, but lets not focus on the facts, this is Trump after all…\nThe loss of Kareem Hunt is definitely rough, but his quick trigger finger in picking up Spencer Ware is numbing the pain. \nWith a great trio of pass catchers (Hilton, Allen, Ebron), any week can be the week they go off for 35 points, OR finish the day with 2 catches for 20 yards..\nWe’ll see if he’s still in the white house after next week…\nGame of Jones\nYour league leading scorer, the only team to break the 1900 points for barrier coming in at a whopping 1911.37 on the season - and average of 147 points per week. \nThey are a bit roughed up right now with Connor on the mend…thank god for the bye week. \nBig decisions between playing Luck or Watson could be a point of concern. \nBut with Zeke, Woods and a revitalized Cooper…the seed is strong…\n\nTWO HUGE playoff matchups this week. and what a start last night was!\nCutlets Bottom Vs. ODeezus\nWow, just wow…Derrick Henrys star turn last night, the highest scoring game for a player this season…won and lost many a fantasy players playoff matchups this week…but thats when he was played…Unfortunately for Cutlets Bottom, he went with the OTHER Titans RB…a decision that I’m sure will haunt him for years to come…especially if he can’t pull off the win this week. \nFor ODeezus, this has been a legendary comeback.  He’s gone 5-2 the last 7 weeks (with 4 in a row) heading into the playoffs and have 5, yes 5, starting caliber RB’s.  He’s also managed to finish 3rd in points scored this season despite starting the year with abysmal performances. \nLady luck (or lady fantasy football reddit) might be on his side this season. \nHome Bologna Vs. AceBoogie\nHome Bologna got off to a scorching start this year with a 6-1 record, but has gone 2-4 the back half of the year, stumbling from the top spot and a bye week, to having to a face a scary Aceboogie in Round 1. Surprisingly, the downfall for Home Bologna seems to have been when Cleveland traded Carlos Hyde, essentially turning him from a reliable RB1/2 to a legit waiver drop. Thielan and Adams are both top 15 players this season so anything can happen.  NEEDS Gordon back this week, could be the difference between a playoff run and a precipitous fall from grace. \nHis head was getting REAL BIG, and the fantasy gods might be looking to strike him down. \nAceBoogie has gone 6-2 to finish their season after starting 1-4.  Cam and Christian are a legit scary duo…with Christian catching so many touchdowns, those essentially become 2-for-1’s.  Filling out the squad with Ingram (whose laughing now at that draft day trade!) and Zach Ertz allows quite a few high scoring options week in and week out. \nAS FOR NEXT WEEK\nPlayoffs have “re-seeding” meaning TRUMP 2020 will play the LOWEST seed…and Game of Jones the HIGHEST seed… Looking like our 5 and 6 seeds have the inside track this week and all the late season momentum needed to carry a late season run.  Game of Jones has to be happy about that.\n\nHOW THE FUCK DID WE GET HERE?!?!?!?!?!?\nCutlets Bottom almost pulled off the ODONNELL SWEEP, by narrowly beating ODeezus, despite leaving a 50 point scorer on the bench.  Cutlet then went onto the next ODonnell, and came away victorious…by 1.7 points!!!  WOW What a close game!  Can’t believe it!  This sucks! Marco is about to go 2 for 3 in championships vs. seasons…Oh wait, Oh my God…This can’t be…ZEKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\nYes..just like that, with the scoring adjustment taking a fumble away from Zeke, giving him back 2 points…and putting the COMMISIONER Game of Jones the WIN…by .25 points!!!\nSuch a devastating blow that will go down in the history of not just our league, but all of fantasy football. \nThe Aceboogie might have just lost Cam for the year, but they took care of business in the Wildcard round by smoking Home Balogna Part deux…who despite their breakout year…only put up 83 points in their first and only playoff game.  Tough way to end the season for Home Balogna. \nThat led Ace to the semi-finals against top seed, the 12-1 juggernaut known as Trump 2020.  Felt that Trump caught some serious luck throughout the year, but he almost pulled the impossible in the semi….heading into Monday night projected to lose by close to 60…he made it a game thanks to some timely performances, and lack there of from Aceboogies top guys…All that was for naught that, as was the season, the 5 point loss to Aceboogie will be tough to swallow heading into the offseason, knowing that he left some quality points on the board…\nThat leaves us to the SHIP…\nGame of Jones vs. Aceboogie\nIncluding this season, Game of Jones is 3-1 against Aceboogie historically, but this is Game of Jones first ever championship game, and Ace has played in a championship before…our inaugural season where he lost by 2 points to eventual champion Hoodie Cru. \nBoth teams are missing some stars this week…Cam is out for the year for Ace and Connor looks to be out again this week for Game of Jones…The heads up from ODeezus Wednesday night about the Zeke point change allowed Game of Jones to stock up on this weeks streamers\nAll will be decided by the end of Sunday night…\nFor the winner of the 3rd place game you’ll be receiving $150 - your money back!\nSecond place will take home $300 - doubling their money on the season. \n1st place will get the ring…..$1000….and if a certain team wins…just maybe they will be receiving a CHAMPIONSHIP BELT\nGod speed, Hell of a season…",

(sack fumblers jumps and screams for joy)…..and now…will Antonio be making the long walk to the commissioners office now that he’s a raper? check this space for updates on how much worse of a person he is!\n\nGood pick up / Bad drop? - Sack fumblers again…dropped Shady McCoy when he was dropped from the Bills…only to be picked up by the chiefs and WattmeWhip.  Looks good for WattmeWhip on paper, but can Shady carve out a consistent impact on the leagues most dominant offense?\n\nThe big Waivers this week…\n* Malcom brown to Laces Out for $31\n* Chris Thompson to Sack Fumblers for $32\n* Scary Terry McLaurin to Game of Jones for $30\n* Gio bernand ($12), Carlos Hyde ($13), John Ross ($15), and Rex Burkhead ($20) round out the other big pickups this week.\n\nCutlets Bottom DESTROYS Games of Jones - 191-110\n* Call it payback for last seasons semi final game which was “stolen” from Cutlets bottom and gifted to Game of Jones on his route to the Championship. If this is all the Karma that comes from that, the commish is happy.\n* Congrats on the week 1 points win - check the ol’ venmo. \n* Couple double 0’s on the board for commish…hard to come back from…but he might have a player in DK Metcalf…\n\nWattmeWhipp off to a STRONG start against Drinking (never been to the playoffs) Forte - 182-107\n* This one was never really close, Forte had some poor performances from his 2 starting WRs, and Trubisky looked like Trubisky.  \n* WattmeWhips team is stacked across the board and will be tough to beat should his flex’s keep playing the way they have through 1 week.\n\nTrump 2020 ROLLS into 2019 with a big win against Home Balogna. 158-110\n* Picking up where they left off in their dominating virgin season in 2018, Trump 2020 made up for the lack of Luck by picking up Kirk (thank god we dont throw anymore) Cousins.  That wasn’t what brought the victory tho… that goes to SF Def dominating the hapless bucs and and special thanks to the COMMISH for declining to trade for Ekeler because as he said he's “just a a handcuff”….well Trump was right (never thought i’d type THAT sentence) and Ekeler is way waaaaay more than just a handcuff. \n* Home Balogna lost Hill for a few weeks, and now might have to give it a go week two without Mixon as well…Going to be hard to roster 2 injured WR (hill/green) as well as A RETIRED WR!!!! BALDWIN IS NOT IN THE LEAGUE\n\nKnickerbockers “SQUEEKS” by Aceboogie - 162-143\n* SAMMY WATKINS have yourself a day!  With even a great 20 point performance from Watkins, Knickerbockers would have lost to Aceboogie…but alas, this was not just a great performance, it was an ALLTIMER.\n* For Aceboogie - McCaffrey is the prodigal son.  He’s incredible, and will be the reason to fear this team all year long.\n\nLaces Out says NICE TRY to the Sack Fumblers. 159-128\n* Great drafting, year after year for Laces who has been one of the most consistent players in our league…Gallup and Jacobs are breakouts and pairing wentz and jackson is a veteran savvy move.\n* Sack Fumblers…lets see what happens with Antonio but this isn’t looking good.  Great days from 3 players, and then shit days from everyone else, brings you to 0-1\n\nNastiest Sack CANT CATCH A BREAK losing to Leveons Career in the closest match up of the week. 135-121\n* Looking at both rosters isn’t leaving me with much hope for either teams future….\n\nHoodie Cru GETS BY ODeezus.  139-107\n* Not a route, but not exactly close.  Surprised this is the team ODeezus drafted, not nearly enough Cowboys. \n* Hoodie Cru found a stud in Hollywood Brown with Diggs barely getting targets in the new look vikings offense things can get ugly this season.  BUT Mahomes is better than Jesus or Brady or Jim Jones or whoever you pray to...so there’s always a chance\n\nTILL NEXT WEEK SUCKERS\nCOMMISH",

And Danny Dimes is a thing!\n\nHome Bologna seems to have been hit the hardest…losing Hill and Brees and more or less all hope.  He’s flipped Hill as well as AJ Green (still hurt) to Sack Fumblers and ODeezus respectively, trying desperately to cling to some semblance of hope.\n\nSack Fumblers also managed to pull a trade with Trump 2020, flipping average players back and forth.\n\nKnickerbockers won the bidding war for Gallman as he looks to take over the NYG backfield.\n\nBefore that $25 was spent on Demarcus Robinson on the chiefs, and a whopping $40 for Adrian Peterson (not the best move commish..).\n\nALL THIS TALK ABOUT WAVIER BIDDING RAISES AN IDEA THAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO VOTE ON.\n\nDO WE WANT TO ALLOW TRADING FAAB $?  ON THE BACKEND, WE CAN ADJUST FAAB BALANCE, SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO INCLUDE IN A TRADE NEGOTIATION TO SWEETEN THE OFFER, THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED.\n\nBEN AND I THINK THIS IS COOL, SO THATS ALREADY TWO YES VOTES.  MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD.\n\nNext week’s update will be brought to you by Big Ben.\n\nCommish Out\n\nAND WE’RE BACK!\n\nThis season is shaping up to be an all timer.  12 teams still in legit contention to make the playoffs…separated by just two games..with 4 games to go..\n\nBreaking down the teams, and what needs to happen the rest of the way for a playoff push.\n\nTHE 6-3 TEAMS\n\nWorst-to-first for The Nastiest Sack.  TBH, watching the PATS DEF consistently score 20+ points, leaving them as the FOURTH highest scoring “player”, and 1 of 6 to have over 200 points so far this season….almost made me quit fantasy.\n\nFor Nastiest Sack to make waves down the stretch, they need the Pats DEF to avoid regressing to the mean…\n\nODeezus has a consistent squad, led by Lockett (legit top 5 WR in football).  Chubb needs to maintain his workload for the disappointing Browns and Henry needs to stay out of the doctors office for this team to make a deep run.\n\nGetting a healthy AJ Green back will be nice, but who will be throwing him the ball?\n\nNo surprise here but Laces Out finds themselves once again, in the thick of the playoff push.  They’ve been carried by the otherworldly Aaron Jones this season, and similar to above, if OBJ can help turn things around in Cleveland, that would form a solid 1-2 punch come December.\n\nThe 5-4 TEAMS\n\nWattmeWhip, Sack Fumblers, Cutlets Bottom and Trump 2020 are all sitting at 5-4, AND playing each other this week.  Now these are the kind of late season matchups that make or break seasons.\n\nIf the season ended today, only 3 of these 4 teams would make the playoffs, so its safe to say that each need a win this week, but only 2 will come away with one.  Lets look ahead at the matchups.\n\nCutlet Bottom Vs. Sack Fumblers.\n\nThis is a huge BYE Week-week for Sack fumblers with Hopkins, freeman, sanders and jeffery all on by.  Despite all this, Lamar Jackson is one of the most dominant offensive players I’ve ever seen, and with him on your roster, real football or fake, you have a chance for a massive game and even more massive victory during the home stretch of the regular season.\n\nCutlets Bottom has consistency across the board and has to hope Julio gets into the end zone (he hasn’t scored since week 3), but they are going up against the saints and you’d have to imagine him living on Lattimore Island.\n\nTrump 2020 vs. WattmeWhip\n\nTrump has scored the 11th most points in the league this year, yet sit at 5-4, thanks in large part for having the second fewest points scored against this year (only 3 more than last).  With that said, and jokes aside about him, true to his name, not winning the popular vote…his team is stacked with Evans, Bell, Singletary, Montgomery…he just needs some consistent scoring these next few weeks, because the points they’ve been putting up won’t cut it much longer.\n\nWattmeWhip has bounced around every spot in the top 5 this year.  Couple weeks slipped away earlier in the season but this is a team that is built for the postseason with great WR’s and high volume RB’s…not to mention Deshaun Watson who might actually be Michael Jordan in shoulder pads.\n\nThe 4-5 TEAMS\n\nPretty much need to win out the rest of the season, which is doable and daunting at the same time.  I think we see at least 2 of the following teams in the playoffs despite all currently being out as of today.\n\nWhy they can make it?\n\nAceboogie - one word. McCaffrey.\n\nLeveon career - congrats on the weekly point win, despite benching a 22 point player for one who was inactive!  This team is built on current and former Seahawks.  He goes as they go.\n\nGame of Jones - Zeke is a freak. Gordon getting going, Godwin and Ingram, and IR stash of Brees paying off…. In this commissioners humble opinion, this is NOT A TEAM YOU WANT TO SEE IN DECEMBER.\n\nKnickerbockers - Rodgers, Saquan, Kittle is as good as a big three as there is in our league. If Hunt can come back and steal carries from Chubb, this team will be a tough out.  Also would like to point out to all the Watkins bandwagoners (after week 1), that he scored more in week 1 than he has the rest of the season combined.\n\nHoodie Cru - While sitting at 4-5, can’t find much to be excited about.  Mahomes needs to come back in a major way to make up for the inconsistency across the rest of the (strong) roster.\n\nEveryone needs a win\n\nDrinking Fortes - keep fighting!  Avoid the toilet!\n\nHome Balogna - projected for 25 points this week with literally the entire team on BYE…if you were sitting at 8-1 or 7-2 I’d like the strategy, give up 1 game, whatevs…but alas…your not.  Don’t give up and don’t fire sale your guys…never should have allowed that Tyreek Hill trade to go through!\n\nBack next week, or next month, or maybe will just wait to the draft next year…haven’t decided.\n\nCOMMISH",

    "content": "Gentleman,\n\nFelt it was time you heard from the commissioner, as I'm sure you're chomping at the bit for the plan for fantasy football this fall.\n\nThis now marks two years in a row where Vegas is off the table, last year it was because of the delays in building the Raiders stadium, this year, it's good ol' Covid-19.  Whata world. Maybe next year.\n\nGiven the current pandemic, I will be relaxing my #1 rule: Must draft in person.\n\nWith that said, I'm still happy to have folks over my backyard, however we'll likely all be required to have a computer, and draft virtually (in person).\n\nSeptember 5 is the start of the Football season, and with me likely away most of August, I'm targeting Saturday the 29th of August for our DRAFT.\n\nGiven we'll be doing this virtually, I'm not going to stress as much this year on picking the perfect day for everyone, make the time or you're out of the league lol.\n\nIf you do not plan on playing this year, let me know ASAP.\n\nPlease follow up with Ben (Deputy Commish and Champion) for any potential rule changes.\n\nPlease follow up with Mike O (Players Association President) for any complaints.\n\nCommish OUT\n\nHello from sunny California.\n\nWhat a year it's been, pandemics, lockdowns, road trips, and cross country moves.  I found comfort in the one and only constant, the thing that made life feel \"normal\" - inevitable and predictable pain and suffering caused by fantasy football.\n\nApologies for the lack of write ups this year, without being stuck in an office, or in fact working at all, I hadn't had a reason to waste/kill time writing these!\n\nMake no mistake about it, you are all getting vaccinated and will be flying to Vegas in August for the draft.  With flight/hotel prices where they are right now, I'm considering booking pretty far in advance to fully commit.\n\nHere's how we did!\n\nACEboogie - couldn't get things going this year, finishing 3-10 and with less points than Knickerbockers - so a lovely toilet award awaits. Kittle got hurt, and despite having King Henry, they just couldn't field a competitive team week to week - yes including the week where they scored an eye popping 65 points...\n\nKnickerbockers - mentioned above, finished 3-10.  Losing McCaffrey for most of the season and not picking up his handcuff really hurt - outside of stars Evans and Watson, they just couldn't get it going.\n\nHome Bologna - shocked the world by not receiving the toilet despite scoring the fewest points this season.  The fact that this squad won 5 games is a testament to how truly stupid fantasy football is.\n\nDrinking Fortes - was feeling himself to start the season 4-3, with their first ever high score week.  Alas, the last 6 weeks they went 1-5 and found their rightful place outside of the playoffs once again.  I have to check the league history, but I think this might be the longest non playoff streak in the league.\n\nCutlets Bottom - just had shit luck this year with a whopping and league leading 1900 point against.  This is a good team on paper, but when you go up against another team's best week, week after week, there just isn't much you can do.\n\nLaces Out - had a consistently mediocre season - perhaps making more moves (tied for fewest with 8) would have given them enough wins to break through.\n\nGame of Jones - well fuck mike thomas, looking forward to next years draft when i avoid him on purpose, only to then see him catch 150 balls for 1800 yards and 14 TDs...\n\nHoodieCru - bad year to go all in on the Cowboys offense, but I respect it all the same - playoffs for the boys are in sight!  But hoodie cru has no one to blame but bad luck, despite having the fewest points scored against this season (1558) and starting 5-2 the back half of the season really sunk any chance at the playoffs.\n\nSackfumblers - our reigning champion and league leader in trades, transactions, and as we all know - trade requests.  They rode a 5 game winning streak to close out the season and sneak into the playoffs where they were resoundingly beat by one of our championship contenders.\n\nWattmeWhip - put together one of their better seasons, somehow managing to correctly play a star qb on the right week almost every week.  Despite putting up 158 points in the quarterfinals they were outmatched and lost by 10 - a heartbreaker.  But all things considered this team has had one hell of a year, culminating in an engagement! congrats PJ!\n\nLeveons Career - put together a rocking season despite being based in brazil and (hopefully) avoiding STDs left and right.  Despite a solid season and start to the playoffs (159 in their loss in the semi finals) you can't overcome the highest scoring week in the history of our league.\n\nTrump/Kaep 2020 - put together an absolutely terrifying team stacking mahomes and hill, while having drafting Keenan Allen and quickly picking up Justin Jefferson.  This team was my pick/prediction when the playoffs started but a down week for Allen (2.6 points) and a monstrous week from their opponent ended what could have been a championship run.  But again, things aren't so bad as they welcomed their second baby to the world - congrats on having twice as many kids as the rest of the league combined!\n\nAND NOW THE CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nBoth Odeezus and The nastiest sack have had wildly successful seasons - a combination of drafting, working the waiver and some injury health/luck contributed to both of their success. Having the 1st and 3rd most points scored this season was a clear tell that their success in the playoffs (odeezus putting up 177 and 180 in back to back weeks, and nastiest sack with a first round bye and a monstrous 211 in the semis) was earned.\n\nAfter tonight we'll have a winner...and it all rests on the shoulders of Josh Allen - who among us predicted that to start the season??  One team will win $1000, the other $300 - with the difference being a PS5, an extra controller and a couple of games...Best of luck to both, but I can't deny I'm rooting for ODeezus, who with a win will join his brother Game of Jones as league champions.\n\nTill next year!\nCOMMISH",

Going for their 2nd Chip in 3 years.\n\nODEEZUS - The season has taught us that if you have Kelce, you just might win every week.  Despite a relatively flawed roster, they do just enough to then be carried by a 4TD Kelce game.  Can't deny the perfect timing pickup of Justin Fields who casually dropped 86 points over two weeks...The fear of him getting smacked around too much while running might have come to fruition as it sounds like his shoulder is no longer a part of his body.  Let's see if oldman Brady can pick up the pieces. After losing in the finals the last two years, will they finally make it over the hump?\n\nThe Sack Fumblers - Strongest team on paper, they are absolutely stacked...Deebo, King Henry, Scary Terry, Jamal \"12 TD breakout\" Williams and of course their bold bid for Kenneth Walker...And those are just the stars...Every position on this team is a plus, so it will come down to matchups and injury luck...but if those shakeout the right way, The Sack Fumblers could be on their way to their second chip.\n\nEberflusMyDikta - Solid team with no true standout, but anything is possible when deploying DK, Kamara and AJ Brown.  Herbert's down year stunted this team a bit but savvy pickups and highly active waiver wiring has kept this team firmly in the hunt. They won the chip way back in 2016...can they make it back to the mountain top?\n\nAs for the remaining four teams in the playoffs...here are a few matchups to keep an eye on this week.  Teams 5 through 12 are separated by 2 games, and teams 6 through 12 are separated by only 1 game!  That's the definition of close....These are some high stakes matchups that are happening this week, winners of these games will be looking good, losers will have to fight and claw and hope for the best in next week's regular season finale.\n\nGames of Jones (6) vs. Throwin Bombz Banging Momz (12)\n- With Game of Jones high points for, they need wins at this stage.  Their big 3 of Jefferson, Chubb, Jacobs can go off each and every week...will there ever be a week when they go off at the same time?  Having already won 2 Chips, Game of Jones is used to the spotlight and lives for the pressure!\n- Throwin Bombz have had an up and down season.  Needs big weeks out of Jones, Swift and Kittle the remainder of the way to make some noise, get in the playoffs, and see what happens.\n\nFeeling Good (9) vs. WattmeWhip (7)\n- Feeling Good, in their first season in the league has done just enough to be sitting at 9...one spot out of playoffs.. But with Higgins, Cook, and the incredible Amon Ra St Brown, they have just enough to make a run. \n- WattmeWhip lost Cooper Kupp, and when you lose someone at that level it's hard to maintain.  With that said, they've pulled together enough wins led by Cooper and Stevenson to be in the hunt at this late stage.\n\nNaj Mahill (5) vs. HoodieCru (8)\n- Naj Mahill has dealt with some relatively disappointing seasons from Sutton, Aiyuk, Sanders, Harris...but as their names suggests, they employe Tyreek Hill who could be the best receiver (or atleast fantasy reciever) in the world.  He can put up 30+ any given week, and when he does, Naj Mahill typically take home the W. \n- HoodieCru has great WR's (Adams, Waddle), a premier RB (McCaffrey) and two intriguing QB options (Burrow/Watson), they are built for the playoffs, and sitting in the 8 spot they control their own destiny!\n\nThat's all for this week, GodSpeed and go USA!\n\nCOMMISH",

    "content": "Well that’s all she wrote!\n\nAs I’m sure you’ve guessed…yours truly, is once again…CHAMPION!\n\nI know how you must be feeling - “how does he keep winning?”, “how do I model my strategy after his?”, “should I change my team name and rebrand next year?”\n\nWell my friends, the answers are unknown.\n\nGames of Jones started the season 4-6 with a handful of blowout losses, a couple close calls, and some devastating injury luck….all to go on a 4 game winning streak to end the season 8-6 as the 5th seed (of 8) in the playoffs.\n\nWho got them there?\n\nNo doubt Justin Jefferson was the best player in fantasy this season - and rightfully so, he led Game of Jones to victory time and time again. Despite a terrifying and horrible performance in the championship, Jefferson still averaged 21 points per game this season finishing as the 6th highest scoring player, and highest scoring WR. He was Game of Jones' 1st round pick (pick 6!)\n\nChubb had a down back half of the season with the addition of Watson in the Browns offense, but still manager to churn out yards at an impressive pace.  He carried the team early on as they dealt with injuries. He was Game of Jones 2nd round pick and the 23rd overall selection.\n\nGames of Jones’ 3rd round pick was a bust - Elijah Mitchell….he is now on this owners ‘Do not draft’ list\n\nIn the fourth round Games of Jones selected Dalton Shultz…even now looking back that was a bit of a reach…he was hurt or barely used the majority of the season…but when the rubber met the road, he put up a MONSTROUS 24 point performance in the championship game.  He will now be referred to as “Championship Shultzy” in the commissioners household.\n\nThe 5th round brought the STEAL of the draft - with Game of Jones picking up Josh Jacobs who despite tough reports coming out of training camp finished with a whopping 1653 yards, 12 td, 53 rec, and 400 rec yards….making him the 10th ranked player overall and 3rd ranked RB… As I’ve always said, championships are won in the 5th round!\n\nIn the 6th, Game of Jones was openly mocked for selecting Buf Def…but having the 37th ranked “player” in fantasy, and the 6th ranked def, provided a floor and piece of mind that only prior fantasy champions can understand.\n\nIn the 7th, Game of Jones went “homer” and picked Dak - hurt, some rough games, wild interceptions and pick 6’s, but again provided a stable enough floor to let the skill players do their thing on this squad.\n\nRound 8-14 consisted of picks that WERE NOT on the championship roster.  Gotta makes moves to make moves…\n\nBiggest pick up has to be D’Onta Foreman who had some monster weeks.  JK Dobbins stashed on IR brought some solid play to end the season.  And last and certainly not least, playoff MVP…picked up earlier in the season, then dropped, then picked up AND STARTED for the semi-final (17 points) and championship (20 points)…was the one and only Richie James…\n\nI know I know - it's clear from this write up that fantasy is entirely luck, mostly pain, and a gigantic waste of time.  But boy do I love winning!\n\n2nd place funds being sent to Feeling Good who had a great run and remarkable first year in the league.\n\n1st place funds staying with ya boy.\n\nTBD what gets donated lol…may just make a deposit to the Human Fund (Seinfeld reference) to help prepare for OD Baby Girl in March.\n\nHere is a shitty picture of the ring..  It’s my 3rd....Whatever...no big deal...\n\nAll three are dangling on a chain in my room, waiting for the moment we finally have a draft in Vegas so I can rock it and rub it in all of your faces.\n\nTill next year!\n\nCOMMISH",

I'm also open to bringing back the $50 weekly, upping the buy-in back to $150.  Hell, I'm up for increasing the buy-in as well ($200, $250..etc) now that we're not all 25 year olds living on salami and cocaine.  Let me know your preference, I'll take an informal poll and follow up with the group with what we decide.  I vote for option D\n* Option A - $100 Buy-in = $1000 1st place, $400 2nd place\n* Option B - $150 Buy-in = $1000 1st place, $400 2nd place, $50 weekly high score bonus\n* Option C - $200 Buy-in = $1500 1st place, $400 2nd place, $200 3rd place, $50 weekly high score bonus\n* Option D - $250 Buy-in = $2000 1st place, $600 2nd place, $200 3rd place, $50 weekly high score bonus\nStill early, but next season (2024) will be our 10th as a league, and I'd love nothing more than to book a suite in Vegas for a few nights, do our draft, and have an old fashioned roast with all of you. Let's keep that in mind as we keep momentum going this year.\n\nOh, how can I forget.  I'm a repeat champion who has won 3 of the last 5 championships!!  Who is coming for the crown??\n\nGood luck, and I'm looking forward to another season.\n\nCOMMISH",

    "content": "Well, week 1 is in the books!  What a week it was!\n\nBig headline is of course Rodgers going down after 4 plays and 1 pass.  I for one am excited for Zach Wilson 2.0… This leaves our week 1 high score winner (Easy E’s) without his primary starter.  Will he go with Goff (on his bench) or will he work the waiver?  They pulled out an easy win against Laces Out, who is lucky Danny Jones got out of MetLife alive against that dominating Cowboys Def (highest scoring player in week 1!)\n\n2nd highest scorer this week, our league runner up last season, Feeling Good, was hit with the injury bug already as well seeing JK Dobbins go down once again to start a season. Still, it was enough to pick up the win on Aceboogie who’s high scoring DEF (NY Jets) had a 3rd of the teams points…will need more from Hurts, Moore, Connor and McLaurin if they want to turn things around.  Gotta hope and pray the Wilson to Wilson jets connection gets in sync.\n\nIt Was Just A Massage (formerly Trump2024) picked up the win on the back of Aiyuk, who is looking like a beast and early season “best pick” award winner.  Was helped by Eberflus having two guys (Goedert + Sky Moore) combine for a whopping .40 points…\n\nOur back to back champion - Game of Jones - came out the gates squeaking by with a win - all thanks to their first round pick Tyreek Hill having the best offensive day of the young season.  Gotta hope Burrow and Higgins combine for more than 3.18 points going forward!  Hoodie cru's was looking good early with a pretty loaded team, but will need far more output from their running backs if they want any shot at the playoffs.  Herbert continues to collect dust on the bench despite being the 6th highest scoring QB in week 1.\n\nDespite the autodraft team - Malort came out of week 1 with the win and possibly the strongest RB room in the league with Pollard, Jones, Montgomery.  For Knickerbockers, gotta believe Lamar will start putting up his usual numbers sooner rather than later, Etienne looked the part of a 1st/2nd round pick, and Pitts once again looked electric when they threw him the ball…why the Falcons aren’t throwing it to him every play is a mystery.\n\nIn his first foray in the league, Joe Buck Yourself took down league regular ODEEZUS.  Both teams need more from their guys to compete this season.  For Buck, Ekeler looked the part, and Allen/Hopkins looked decent in their matchup with Father Time.  ODEEZUS needs Kupp and his 20+ point games back ASAP or this could be a long season.\n\nDespite losing Kelce, couldn’t help but expect more from Swiftly, the other new entrant in the league. Allen, Deebo, Walker all had mediocre days - will need more from that trio if Kelce stays on the mend.  Also…Kelce being linked to T Swift in real life??  Did this team speak that into existence??  WattmeWhip, perennial playoff team, got out to a great start and will be formidable this season.\n\nTill next week, keep your eyes on the wire\nCOMMISH",

    "content": "Well the cream continues to rise!\n\nCongrats to Joe Buck Yourself who narrowly beat out ya boy Game of Jones for high score of the week.  Another notch on your belt, making this his 3rd of the season (33% of the season).\n\nBuck Yourself is also sitting comfortably in first place with the best record and most points scored through 9 weeks this year.  Would take a collapse of monumental proportions to miss the playoffs at this point.  Now it’s about tweaking the fringes of the team, and praying for health when it comes to his LAC power duo.\n\nIn 2nd and 3rd are WattmeWhip and Joshin Swiftly who both came up short this past week, dropping to 7-2.  \n* WattmeWhip is staying strong despite Jefferson hitting the IR.  Sounds like he might be close to a return, so when added to the core of Hall, Ford, Gibbs, and Puka this team will have a real chance to do some damage.  \n* Joshin Shifty only managed to put up 95 points this week, but that’s in thanks to their RB and WR starters putting up a whopping 5.3 points this week.  Obviously he’ll see better days from that group, but will need T swift showing up to chiefs game to give Kelce that extra juice it seems he now needs to dominate. \nKnickerbockers, Massage, and ODEEZUS are all sitting above .500 at 5-4.  Playoffs are in their view if they keep steady through the end of the season. \n* Knickerbockers left points on the bench last week, but you really can’t blame him for starting Lamar over stroud and Pitts over kmet.  Consistently in the weekly high score conversation, often thanks to AJ Brown, this team will be a tough out. \n* It was just a Massage has ridden the emergence of Ceedee Lamb as the number 1 WR he was always envisioned to be.  Troubling signs for Barkley and the Gmen could limit this teams longevity. \n* ODEEZUS believes championships are won on the wire, proven by the 41 transactions he has made, 15 more than the next highest team. Kyler might be back to give their QB ceiling a boost and Ferguson’s connection with Dak this back half of the season could be a game breaker at the TE spot week to week. \nThe 7 and 8 spots, the last two in the playoffs if the season ended today belong to Game of Jones and Laces Out\n* Game of Jones has a healthy squad on the come up, with Achane and Kyren sitting pretty on IR.  Keep up the good work squad, help is on the way. \n* Laces out plays the QB matchups each week deciding on Howell and Mayfield - that decision looms large each week as both are relatively unpredictable.  But what is predictable is McCaffrey being an absolute beast.  Hard to fathom he was drafted with the 4th pick.\nEasy E’s and Malort are the other two squads in the thick of things with 4-5 records.  \n* Easy E won in the weeks Dallas DEF dominates, will need the boys to to get after an easy stretch of games (NYG, CAR, WAS) to make a true push towards the playoffs. \n* Malort is looking to get healthy if they want to make a run at things.  Montgomery should be back soon, Jones rounding into form, London getting back on the field (despite Arthur smiths inexplicable play calling).  But that all might be moot if Pollard continues running directly into his lineman’s back. \nBottom of the league is AceBoogie (most points against this season), Hoodie Cru (drafted mahomes 1…), Feeling Good (Bijan not part of the offense in ATL anymore? WTF?), and Eberflus (lowest points scored this season).\n\nBut have no fear bottom feeders!  There are 5 weeks left of the regular fantasy season and only 3 games (in the loss column) separating the last team (2-7) and the 4th team (5-4).  The season is a long one and isn’t won in September and October.  Get your minds right for the final push these next two months.\n\nCOMMISH",

WRs who can go off each week in Hopkins, Godwin, Meyers, brown (in addition to Allen).  TE is a weak spot but that is nothing new.\n* Big question for their playoff fate is whether or not they make the right start / sit decisions each week as they fill the roster.  Couple miss plays this time of year can derail a historic season in the blink of an eye!\nOfficially out:\n\n*8 playoff spots*\n“1” teams have clinched\nBottom playoff seed currently has 6 losses - if those teams lose the last 2 of the season - that would be 8 losses in the L column - so that is the bar teams need to clear (not to mention points scored…) if they want a spot in the dance.\n\nFeeling Good (XX record)\n* Hit their 9th loss last week, and picked up their 10th this week. They are out of the playoff picture. \n* Every other team in the league likely tried to trade for Bijan or Amon Ra at one point - their steadfast denial of those trades (or low quality of offers) led to sticking with one of the top 1-2 punches coming out of the draft…all that did was lead to heart break week and after week. Including this week, losing out to Eberflus (2nd to last team) thanks to a relatively garbage time rushing TD by Zay Flowers..\n\nAceBoogie (XX record)\n* Picked up their 9th loss this week in what will go down as a season to forget. \n* Low points scored and high points against... Mismanagement x bad luck = out of the playoffs. \n* Rodgers going down undoubtedly tanked this team (Wilson) despite MVP type season for Jalen Hurts.\n\nLast two weeks of the season we’ll catch up with other teams who have clinched the playoffs - and those who clinched missing the playoffs.\n\nPlayoff preview comes in the lead up to week 15!\n\nCOMMISH",

They did get the win in week 1 134-114 but that team was starting Watson/knox/williams all who are now on IR (they even had Andrews who was out that week, on their bench..another IR fella)\n\nEven with a win, they aren’t exactly in given their points scored falls below 4 of the 5 teams sitting at 7-6.  So they will need to win with a BIG points scored total, or hope one of the teams ahead of them put up a sub ~75 point score in a loss…Not impossible!\n\nFeeling Good vs Ace Boogie\n* Who will be in last?\n* In week 1, Feeling good had one of their best weeks and one of their 3 wins against AceBoogie. \n* Dreaming up punishments for next year, and I personally like:\n    * 24 hours in a McDonalds.  Minus 1 hour for every cheese burger eaten.  We’ll see!\n\n***IMPORTANT***\nI commit to making Vegas a reality for the draft next season.  I’m targeting Friday August 23rd to Sunday August 25th. \n* Friday we arrive and party\n* Saturday is all day live draft\n* Sunday everyone goes their own way\nIf you have 0 interest in going to Vegas let me know.  If you consider yourself 100% in let me know.  If you are someone who needs some convincing let me know..\n\nBasically let me (and the rest of the guys) know your thoughts on Vegas next summer so I can start thinking through logistics.\n\nThis will be a live draft, so worth noting how horrible it will be for someone to be in the league, not be there, and still need to draft.  I think PJ M (Malort) did that before and I’m sure he can share with the group how painful that was..\n\nPLAYOFFS NEXT WEEK\n\nCOMMISH",

DMT vape anyone?)\n* “I can live in that ass” - KR\n* Trying to make a pick and having an undisclosed amount of shroom chocolate shoved in my mouth\n* All things Gruden, though disappointed we never made it to whatever sketchy dive bar he recommended\n* “DALVIN Cook!  The running back!” - KR\n* Old stripper trying to sexily eat a chicken drumstick (this image is seared in my mind (in a bad way))\n* Marko getting roasted by the girls for getting yelled at by his wife for being on the computer all day\n* Collectively getting through 10 grams of the good stuff in about 24 hours (animals we are)\nSo much more happened in that marathon session of a draft, including actually drafting teams…Lets look ahead at this week's matchups.  Remember that the team we play this week, we will also play the last week of the season in a rematch.\n\nGame of Jones (Matt) vs. ODEEZUS (Mike)\n* One of the leagues premier rivalries…the OD brothers…back again to kick off a season\n* Pre matchup trade between them will carry weight this week and through the season.\n* Games of Jones with arguably the best WR room in the league (Wilson, London, Higgins, McLaurin)\n* For ODEEZUS, gotta worry a bit about who is throwing to Jefferson, but other than that, solid squad from top to bottom (Burrow, Aiyuk, Henry, Kyren)\n\nEberflusmyDitka (Marko) vs. PurpleReign (Jeff)\n* Quite the start for Purplereign in the league selecting Chase with his 1st pick (can’t blame him!) who is trending towards not playing….1st reminder of the season that fantasy is pain!\n* For Eberflus - having Lamb and Mahomes means any week can be one with a 40+ scorer…Stacking and praying for Worthy to be Pat's guy will in many ways determine if this is a playoff team or championship contender. \nFeeling Good (James) vs. HoodieCru (Will)\n* Despite 5 rookies drafted, and only 1 RB drafted, HoodieCru put together a squad led by Lamar and Gibbs.  Lots of speed, and he’ll need a return to form from his top WRs (Metcalf and Diggs) to reach the promised land. \n* Feeling Good put together a solid big three of Allen, St. Brown and White.  Aubrey (yes the kicker!) is an absolute beast who can bang home 50+ yarders with ease for the boys. \nJoe Buck Yourself (Kevin) vs. Victorious Secret (Garret)\n* Top name in the league (Joe Buckyourself) received the worst draft grade in the league - however that was due to them breaking rules and not having proper K/Def in place to end the draft…Lots of scary injury potential with both McCaffrey and Rodgers leading the way for this squad. \n* Really solid team in year 2 for Victorious secret.  Tons riding on the Eagles (Hurts and Barkley), this team will go as the Eagles go (hopefully for this cowboys fan, things go very poorly). \nKnickerbockers (Hugo) vs. Malort (PJ M)\n* Knickerbockers are relying on some real wild cards this season…will Nacau repeat last year's performance with a healthy Kupp?, Coleman/Nabers forming a high ceiling low floor Rookie WR room.  Ekeler is back or does he need to be put down out back?  Pitts (nuff said)?\n* Malort is hoping for big followup seasons from both Collins and LaPorta.  If they do, and White gets the carries many expect, this will be a solid overall squad.  AJ Brown is still a cheat code and stacking Purdy(QB)/Moody(K) means points on nearly every SF drive this season. \nLaces Out (Nick F) vs. theACEboogie (Nick D)\n* Couple o’ Nicks cutting it up in a long standing league matchup. \n* Will Aceboogies approach of drafting all the Dolphins guys work?  If you think about it, they all score a ton whether they are on 3 fantasy teams or 1.  I love this experiment and will be tuning in to enjoy the MIA/AceBoogie wave of emotion.\n* Solid draft from Laces Out (as usual) with excellent players across all positions.  IN particular the Taylor/Pacheco RB room could be the best/most consistent in the league. \nTittsburg Feelers (PJ O) vs. AK Rossdgers (Kerry)\n* Tittsburg on his 3rd name of the season \n* Tittsburg has in my opinion the best team in the league.  Helped by the league's collective idiocy in allowing Bijan to fall.  That wasn’t all though, Kupp at the turn, Richardson and his potential, Kelce/Rice KC pass catching stack, Smith/Addison as the 2's to stud 1’s…Only injuries will prevent this team from doing damage in the playoffs. \n* AK Rossdgers.  First year back after a multi year hiatus, with a draft that leaves you wanting more.  Stroud and Hall will be studs, Deebo and Pittman vacillate every week giving fantasy owners agita year after year.\nLet's have fun this season, let's let the trades fly, let's make side bets, let's remember that fantasy is pain and that at least one of our first round picks will go down for a season ending injury this weekend!\n\nGo Cowboys,\nCOMMISH",

    "content": "Gentlemen!\n\nWoooo what a week of matchups!\n\nOnly 2 teams won by 20+…and yes, they are the top two teams in the league, the dreaded O’Donnell Brothers…\n\nI’ll be taking the high score for myself after a thorough dismantling of Laces Out who once again found themselves going up against a team's best week.  Laces Out now has 771 points against this season.  Not much you can do when your opponents seemingly get hot every week.\n\nODEEZUS was second highest scoring this week, after 2 straight high scoring weeks.  They sit atop the standings with 4 wins and 737 total points. They beat KnickerBockers who had an excellent week themselves (would have beaten 9 of the other 13 teams this week).\n\nThe other matchups this week all came down to the wire.\n\nJoe Buck Yourself picked up their second win of the season thanks to DJ Moore and the Green Bay defense.  EberflusMyDitka needed more from Mahomes and Worthy on Monday night, and generally need more from Olave and Lamb if they want to hold their playoff positioning this season.\n\nReal barn burner between Feeling Good who took the win this week with a measly 106 points against AK Rossdgers who for the 2nd time this season scored less than 100 points.. Not good. Mooney put up huge numbers on his bench, but he’s a hard to start player.  Still gotta be kicking themselves for not stealing one from Feeling Good who had St Brown and Goedert on bye.\n\nBattle of the Northeastern roommates went to Victorious Secret who outscored Malort by 5 points. If they started Geno Smith over Purdy things would have played out differently and they’d be sitting at 2-3 (a much more palatable record than their current 1-4). Might have found something with Bigsby and Tolbert so all hope is not yet lost.\n\nThe ACEBoogie has continued to slide and is now 2-3 after starting 2-0 with the first two weekly high scores.. The dolphin experience produced about 23 points (from Ace’s top 3 picks)…that’s not going to get it done.  Tittsbrug squeaked this win out by less than 3 points thanks to a resurgent Kelce, and smart plays of Whittington (who?) and Downs (Flacco!). Still waiting for the Bijan breakout, dude is way too talented to be producing as poorly as he is (in fantasy, and real football). Still expect big things from them as Kupp and Richardson get healthy.\n\nLastly, a high scoring thriller between HoodieCru and newcomer Purple Reign.  Purple pulled this one out 168-164 making this the highest scoring matchup of the young season.  Chase having the game he did made this a win, instead of a large loss (even if he scored 20 points), so that pick is looking better and better.  Shaheed, drafted in the 9th round has scored 20+ in 4 of 5 games (the 5th was a goose egg) and might go down as the best pick of the draft. Have no fear, HoodieCru, your team is looking solid.  Your rookies are starting to get used to the speed of the NFL and are poised to get better as the season progresses.\n\nBack to work\n\nCOMMISH",

    "content": "Welcome back gentlemen to another addition of “Fantasy is Pain” brought to you by TheACEBoogie who lost a tight matchup on the back of a stat correction…\n\nBig congrats to the last two weekly winners, Feeling Good put up 171 last week.  But the big story is HoodieCru knocking down your 3 time defending champ (who was sitting in first) with a HUGE score of 192, which if you’re counting at home, is the HIGHEST score of the season.\n\nThe Top (safely in playoff position):\n\nFeeling Good: We’ve heard it before, Josh Allen + Amon-Ra lead this team.  If Najee can keep this up, and Rachaad White returns to form this is a scary playoff squad.  Godwin looks to be out for the year, so that’s a blow.\n\nODEEZUS: Jefferson, Henry (SHEESH…the cowboys didn’t need him!), Burrow, Kyren..all lining up with that big 4.  Aiyuk is the latest casualty of the season so will need their WRs (Doubs, Douglas, Ridley) to step up.\n\nGames of Jones:  Daniels was a massive QB win, but he might be hitting the bench.  Not too worried given Goff waiting in the wings.  Still a strong WR room with Wilson/London/Higgins/McClaurin with solid TE contributors.  Big question facing this squad is Mason and whether or not McCaffrey actually comes back this season.\n\nPurple Reign:  New team in the league starting their career strong. Chase is a beast and lining him up with Shaheed was solid (another one down to injury). With the Cooper trade, this squad has a lot riding on the Bills (Cooper, Cook, Kincaid) as AceBoogie will tell you…3 players from one squad is DICEY.\n\nThe Middle (in the hunt):\n\nVictorious Secret:  2 straight losses dropping them into this category.  Strong squad led by eagles in Hurts and Saquan (that had to be tough to watch for Giants fans..).  Needs more from Dell and Harrison Jr to be a real playoff threat.\n\nEberflusMyDitka:  Low floor and high upside team.  Mahomes hasn’t been himself, taking away from Worthy.  CeeDee (and the Cowboys) are the definition of shambles so we’ll see how that plays out.  Other than that, they need big random weeks from the likes of Mixon/Smith-Njigba/Olave…easier said than done.\n\nTittsburg Feelers: Draft day darlings have to be feeling good about Bijan turning things around.  Need more from Smith and Addison, but Kupp coming back should help shore up the WR room.  Anthony Richardson unable to complete passes and their coaching staff unwilling to use him in the Cam Newton role limits this squads ceiling.\n\ntheACEboogie:  Won’t beat a dead horse on this, but with Tua hopefully coming back in a few weeks (and hopefully staying healthy) I expect a late season run that can make them dangerous (Hill has won me 2 of my 4 championships so I’ll always respect what he can do on the fantasy gridiron).  Timely and strategic waiver moves have kept this team afloat.\n\nLaces Out: 2 straight wins making things interesting though possibly being hit by injury bug (Evans, Kittle, Jennings).  Hoping Taylor gets back to action this week will go a long way in keeping this momentum alive.\n\nAK Rossdgers:  Another team with 2 straight wins, and as I mentioned earlier, juuuuuuust squeaked this one out. Deebo is always an injury risk, but CJ Stroud is such a baller that anything is possible. If Breece keeps this up, he’ll carry them to some more wins.  And while this is a few weeks late, congrats to team owner Kerry for getting engaged!  Promise I won’t hire those exact strippers for your bachelor party!\n\nHoodieCru ( 2-5):  They have put up 990 points this season which is tied for 3rd most in the league.  They score, and have been slammed week in and week out.  Lamar (nuff said), Gibbs, Thomas Jr. DK…this is a good squad.  I remember waaaaaay back in Year 1 of the league they started 0-6 before winning out the season…anything is possible (KG voice)\n\nThe Bottom (work to do):\n\nJoe BuckYourself:  Year 2 decimated by McCaffrey (thanks Gruden!).  Without him back, there isn’t much hope.\n\nKnickerbockers:  Tough season.  Dak stinks, Pitts stinks, Lazard hasn’t been bad but that waiver amount (500+ I believe) still doesn’t make sense, Jameson is gonna be suspended again, Ekeler is 90 years old.  Don’t really see how this team (when compared to others above fighting for playoffs) can get it done.\n\nMalort: 761 points for this season for a whopping 108 per week.  WOOF.\n\nTill next week, \nCOMMISH",

They've stormed into the playoffs for their fifth time, fueled by a fiery seven-game winning streak! Yet, despite their prowess, they remain championship-less—an unfortunate title that mocks this proud franchise. Will this be the year they finally break free from mediocrity? The road to glory is paved with grit; let’s rally behind them and cheer them on towards their first-ever championship victory!\n\nGet ready to feel the excitement! \"Feeling Good\" charges into the playoffs as the formidable 2 seed, boasting a stellar record of 10-4. With an impressive total score of 2002.81 points and a robust all-play record of 111-71, they are riding high on momentum with their current win streak. Though they've yet to taste championship glory in their two playoff appearances—finishing second once and enduring a two-season drought—their time is coming! Can this be the year they shake off those pesky 'never won' tags? Fans should rally behind them because \"Feeling Good\" might just turn that long-awaited championship dream into reality!\n\nWelcome to the ODEEZUS saga, where dreams of glory have been dashed like a balloon at a cactus convention. Entering the playoffs as the 3 seed and boasting an impressive but ultimately futile playoff history, this team stands on the precipice—yet has never tasted championship nectar in eight attempts.  They can’t help but be haunted by near-misses: two second-place finishes and one third. Sure, they scored more points than their opponents during the regular season (1976.5 vs 1735.89), but stats don’t win championships; otherwise they'd have one by now! Will the drought continue for ODEEZUS; will this be just another heartbreak?\n\nLadies and gentlemen, step right up to witness the underdog tale of \"theACEboog1e,\" strutting into the playoffs as the 4 seed with a twinkle in their eye! With an 8-6 record and a sparkling all-play mark of 117-65, they’ve racked up points aplenty—2001.88 to be exact—but alas, fortune has eluded them like a mirage in the desert; zero championships after three playoff appearances! The last time they tasted victory was nine seasons ago—what a drought! Will this team finally break their chains of mediocrity and snag that coveted title? Or will they remain haunted by memories of near-misses? Only time will tell as they march forth on this quest for glory!\n\nAs the \"Purple Reign\" team steps into the playoffs as the 5 seed in their first season in the league.  Their record shows an 8-6 finish, but despite scoring 1830.07 points, they narrowly missed out on greater success with opponents racking up 1834.87 against them. The current two-game winning streak offers a glimmer of hope.\n\nIn the intricate tapestry of fantasy football, \"Victorious Secret\" emerges as a paradox—a team adorned with aspirations yet shadowed by a championship drought spanning an eternity. As the 6 seed, they traverse uncharted waters in their second playoff foray, teetering on the brink of transcendence amid a modest 7-7 record. While others bask in glory, they dwell in humble obscurity; never has this squad tasted victory or ascended to the lofty peaks of podium finishes. Scoring slightly more than their opponents demonstrates resilience but reveals fragility—an echoing reminder of past failures. With two losses haunting them like specters from seasons long gone, will they rise phoenix-like from ashes? Or continue their comedic saga as perennial underdogs? The quest for redemption beckons; can \"Victorious Secret\" finally unveil its true potential and etch its name into history? Only time shall reveal whether fortunes change or laughter echoes once more through the annals of mediocrity.\n\nAh, \"Laces Out,\" the team that wears its heart on its sleeve as they saunter into the playoffs like a lovesick poet yearning for glory. With a record of 7-7 and an all-play score that whispers tales of potential, they've battled through the storm yet find themselves in the shadow of their last championship win in 2017—oh, how time has flown! A fifth playoff appearance beckons with hope after six seasons without gold. Though they’ve graced second place twice, third eludes them like an unrequited romance. Will this be their moment to break free from their drought and reclaim that sweet elixir of victory? Only fate knows if they'll dance again amidst triumphant cheers or wallow in poetic sorrow once more.\n\nOnce upon a field of fantasy dreams, the \"GameOfJones\" team emerges from the shadows as the 8 seed—an underdog with a storied past. With four championships to their name and no droughts in sight since last hoisting the trophy in 2023, they flaunt an impressive playoff pedigree. But can this squad turn their lackluster regular season record of 7-7 into postseason magic? Scoring just shy of their opponents and finishing on a losing streak, doubt lingers like mist before dawn. Yet history whispers that champions rise when least expected; perhaps it's time for another epic saga to unfold, or will they tumble out yet again? The quest for glory begins anew!\n\nCOMMISH",

Game of Jones\n* Rematch of 2K22 season championship game.  That game ended on some controversy as the final matchup included the Damar Hamlin “heart stopped” game, which threw off final scores. \n* Earlier this season (week 13), they faced off in the highest scoring matchup of the season.  Games of Jones edged out Feeling good that week 187 - 180. \n* Projections this week show a Game of Jones edge, but what Yahoo doesn’t take into account is the fact that it is far more likely for Josh Allen to have 40 points than it is for him to 24.  \n* Can Game of Jones keep marching towards their FIFTH Championship in 10 seasons??  \n* Will Feeling Good get over the hump on the way to their 2nd championship appearance in their 3 year league career?\n* “Gotta beat the best to be the best”\n\ntheACEboog1e Vs. Victorious Secret\n* Only fitting these two face off in the semis after the trade drama this season. \n* Back in week 8 of the season ACE beat Victorious Secret 160 - 143 despite only 6 points from their QB.  \n* Of course, that was a very different looking Victorious Secret team…\n* Projections this week predict a very close matchup.  I have a feeling this matchup will bring the drama this weekend.\n\nDespite the Holiday season, I’ll commit to getting a championship preview out next week!\n\nCOMMISH",

    "content": "Congratulations to the 2K24 champion - Victorious Secret!\n\nFeeling Good came up short.  VERY Short.  Honestly, one of the most gutless performances these eyes have ever seen in a championship matchup!\n\nThis is their 3rd season.  The first was a loss in the championship, the second found them in last place, and this season, they once again came up short in the championship…. This year though they won’t even break 100 points…\n\nSo while Malort is in last in the league, and is more than deserving of the Toilet Trophy after the trade to end all trades…I’m unilaritialy declaring that Feeling Good will retain the toilet trophy for another season as punishment for letting us ALL Down!\n\nNow, onto the champion.\n\nNo denying that trade was absolute garbage.  While I still contend there was no collusion.  The trade should never have been allowed to go through, and that’s on me, your commissioner, taking full responsibility.\n\nNext year, we will be reverting back to league voting on trades to ensure the integrity of the league doesn’t get stretched any further.\n\nBUT WITH THAT SAID\n\nThis team was more than just 1 lopsided trade.\n\nThey drafted Barkley who will easily win OPOY with over 2k yards rushing through week 17.  He was wise to stack Barkley with Hurts, collecting pretty much every rushing touchdown the Eagles high powered offense had this season.\n\nThey drafted Ken Walker who had a great season before an injury and waived Chubba Hubbard.\n\nSpeaking of Chubba, this team ATE the criticism from yours truly when that bid was placed, stayed firm, and can now smile down on a league of losers knowing that pickup was arguably the best waiver add of the season.\n\nHurts got hurt this week, Walker officially hit IR, Chubba hit IR…this team was hit hard going into the championship, yet they persevered on the back of their bell cow - Barkley.\n\nWould they have made it all the way to the championship if the trade didn’t go through?  Maybe?  Probably?  It's all luck anyway... Hard to make a season long comparison in the trade when Chubb officially went down, and Tank Dell blew up his knee.   McConkey did go off for 30 points this week (more than Brown + Collins combined), but again, it's hard to make the case that the trade WON the league for this team.\n\nDid it help?  Of course.  But trades are supposed to help.\n\nShould it have been allowed?  No, like I said that’s on me…\n\nHe’s been awfully quiet the last few weeks, so I’m sure the gloating will begin soon, let me be the first to extend a hearty congratulations!  I know winning the chip aint easy.\n\nWe’ll let tonight's game play out and will send funds to 1st, 2nd, 3rd place this week.\n\nGarret, start getting sized for your ring (and send me your address)!\n\nCOMMISH",
